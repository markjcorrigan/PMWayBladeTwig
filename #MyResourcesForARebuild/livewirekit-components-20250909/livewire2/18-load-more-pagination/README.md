## Livewire Kit: Table with "Load More" Pagination

This is a component to show the example of "Load more" unlimited pagination.


### Files of the Component

- app/Http/Livewire/States.php 
- app/Models/State.php
- resources/views/livewire/tailwind/states.blade.php
- resources/views/livewire/bootstrap/states.blade.php


### How to use

- Make sure you have Livewire installed and enabled with `@livewireStyles` and `@livewireScripts`. For more info, read the [official docs](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/2.x/quickstart) 
- Copy files `app/Http/Livewire/States.php` and `resources/views/livewire/states.blade.php` into your own project
- Add/modify your own fields and models, instead of the example States, or maybe rename the full component.
- In Blade file(s), wherever you need to use this component, call it with `@livewire('states')`, or replace `states` with the new name of your component, like `articles`
- Check how it looks and make the changes necessary
