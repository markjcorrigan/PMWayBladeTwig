				Q: I&#8217;ve heard project constraints referred to as the triple 
				constraint. But there are six of them here. What gives?<br />
				<br />
				A: Some project managers focus on Cost, Scope, and Time as the 
				main constraints of a project. But just thinking about those 
				three constraints doesn&#8217;t give a clear picture of all of the 
				constraints you need to account for when planning a project. The 
				important thing here is to understand that Cost, Time, Scope, 
				Quality, Risk, and Resources are all related to each other. You 
				need to pay attention to all of them and if you manage your 
				project in favor of one of them, it will affect the others.<br />
				<br />
				Q: I&#8217;ve heard of an old saying: &#8220;Faster, cheaper, better&#8212;pick 
				two,&#8221; but doesn&#8217;t that mean that there are only two constraints 
				that you can manage at any given time?<br />
				<br />
				A: No, that&#8217;s an old (and somewhat cynical) project management 
				saying. When a project manager says it to a customer or 
				stakeholder, what he is saying is that there&#8217;s no way to reduce 
				cost, shorten the schedule, and increase quality all at the same 
				time. At least one of those things absolutely has to give&#8230; but 
				the saying is a little disingenuous! We already know that all 
				six of the constraints are related to each other, and there&#8217;s 
				almost never an easy, obvious trade-off where you can sacrifice 
				one to improve the others.<br />
				<br />
				The delivery gap is 

defined as the part of the
                project between the start of the EXECUTE STAGE, through
                the STABILIZE STAGE (internal and external testing etc.), to deployment (rollout) 
				and 

finally
                ending up at sign off of the delivery of a successful project and project 
				CLOSE STAGE.&nbsp; 
				<br />
				<br />
				It is 

				when moving across
                this gap that the project must have &quot;scope locked
                down&quot;.&nbsp; 

				In <a href="/epms.php" target="_blank">
				EPMS</a> terms this means we have a project schedule with 
				resources allocated and tasked to this schedule and it is 
				baselined!&nbsp; Remember the baselined project schedule is your 
				plan of how to safely jump the project delivery gap!&nbsp; The 
				schedule is also your
				<a href="/irontriangle.php" target="_blank">

				vital importance of this is 
				not fully understood or accepted as the focus is to &quot;<strong><a href="/cmm.php#justdoit" target="_blank">JUST DO 
				IT</a></strong>&quot;, get on with it a.s.a.p. and start delivering.<br />

		<div id="collapse9" style="display:none" class="auto-style15">
			
				<p>Note:  This is dealt with in depth in the 
				<a href="/charter.php" target="_blank">Charter page of PMWay</a>.  However here is the essence:<br><br>PMWay uses the <strong>&quot;"signed off" Appointment of a Project Manager 
				form&quot;</strong> to officially appoint the Project Manager to run the 
				project.  This is the first stage gate.  <br />
				I.e. without this the Project Manager cannot proceed.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				The <strong>&quot;Project Charter&quot;</strong> works in conjunction with the Appointment of a Project 
				Manager form as a &quot;ticket to ride&quot; / key (once the requirements gap has been defined) to open the second Stage 
				Gate:&nbsp; <br />
                 1.&nbsp; The project manager appointment form is a required, signed off document, to authorize 
				the appointment of the Project Manager for further investigation 
				in INITIATE PHASE and as a way to start to move into PLAN STAGE.<br>The project manager's first job will be to put together a stakeholder 
				register and an initial project charter which must be signed.</p>
				<p>2.&nbsp; The fully completed Charter as a pack of documents - with all key 
				annexures in place, signed off, is a "key" that opens the EXECUTE STAGE GATE, moving the project from PLAN STAGE into 
				EXECUTE STAGE and forms the "contract" and &quot;ticket 
				to ride&quot; on the <a href="/epms.php" target="_blank">Enterprise Project Manager Server)</a> into the EXECUTE STAGE!<br />
				<br />
				Let's look at the above documents from an EPMS Administrator point of 
				view, and see how they are used:
				<ul>
				<li><p>The Project Manager Appointment form allows the EPMS Administrator to create the project manager (as a resource) and the project (the project's name is registered / 
				initial plan created / project web created etc.) on the EPMS server.<br>
				The project is registered in an initial INVESTIGATIVE STAGE. I.e. before PLAN STAGE.<br>
				At this stage it is assumed that weekly meetings are set up and weekly minutes (Risks and Issues) are being created.<br>
				This is done as a platform to allow initial investigation.</p></li>
				<li><p>The Initial Project Charter allows the EPMS administrator to move the 
				project into INITIATE STAGE.</p></li>
				<li><p>The Stakeholder Register is used to register additional resources on the EPMS server.</p></li>
				<li><p>The project manager via project minutes will task the EPMS administrator when to move the project into PLAN STAGE.</p></li>
				<li><p>The final fully completed Project Charter (with Annexures for all the key documents - and 2nd / final sign off on a page after the annexures) is the G for GO to open the EXECUTE STAGE GATE.<br>
				The project manager will change the status on the EPMS server from PLAN STAGE to EXECUTE STAGE.<br>
				The project manager will use this document to baseline the project schedule (signed off by resources who agree with the tasks needed to jump the gap) on the EPMS server.<br>
				I.e. the Charter is the key to open the 
				EXECUTE STAGE GATE (is a quality gate / go, no go gate) between PLAN STAGE and the
				EXECUTE STAGE of the PMWay model!</p></li>
				<li>A mirror project with the same name as the project (but ending in CMMiQC "Quality Control") can also be created for each project on the EPMS to handle the receipt of all project governance.  This project (per segregation of duties) must be run on the EPMS by a PMO project manager / administration clerk and is a cross check that governance is in place before the EPMS administrator can change STATUS on the system.<br>
				I.e. the ProjectNameCMMiQC[NAME][%COMPLETE][STAGE]report it is a cross check with the normal ProjectName [NAME][%COMPLETE][STAGE] report.<br>
				I.e. the PMO can ensure that the project is not outstripping its supply lines from a governance perspective.

				<img alt="" height="256" src="/images/keys.png" width="256" /></p>
				<p>A signed off Project Charter (in INITIATE STAGE) can be a short document, 
				while the signed off Project Charter at the end of the PLAN 
				STAGE will be a document pack with (if required revised Charter body content 
				- reflecting the findings of the PLAN STAGE)&nbsp; supported by detailed annexures 
				fully defining and locking down project scope.&nbsp; <br>
				<br>
				The decision on how detailed the 
				Charter needs to be is left to the discretion of the Project 
				Manager (supported / guided by the Project Office and Sponsor 
				etc.).&nbsp; <br><br>In the opinion of PMWay this is the MOST IMPORTANT PROJECT 
				DOCUMENT which forms a CONTRACT that is signed by the Project 
				Manager, the Project Sponsor and Key Stakeholders and it is this document that defines 
				the final scope of the project.&nbsp; <br>
				</p>
				<hr>
				<p>It is<strong> to this one single and final document pack</strong> 
				(I.e. not as disparate documents, in different versions and 
				scattered all around the place) that the Project Manager 
				(project team), PMO and Stakeholders etc. will turn to at the end of the 
				project to obtain sign off.&nbsp; I.e. Has the 
				final project delivered what has been promised to the client 
				or not?&nbsp; </p>
				<p>It is also <strong>to this one single and final document pack
				</strong> (I.e. again as this is important "not as disparate documents, in different versions 
				and scattered all around the place" that all Project 
				Change Controls will refer when determining changes to the 
				project scope.&nbsp; I.e. is a new baseline needed (EPMS administrator?) or not.<br>
				If the change in scope is to be accepted then the PMWay process 
				above is started again (leveraging off work already done) towards the sign off of a new Project Charter 
				(along with all other key supporting documents).&nbsp; </p>
