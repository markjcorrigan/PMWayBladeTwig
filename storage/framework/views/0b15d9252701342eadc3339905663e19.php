       to understand  (at a high level) how the PMBOK ver 6 Dashboard works.&nbsp; <br>
        I.e. Project Management processes start at the top left of the Dashboard and 'flow&quot; across 
        (and down through the processes, by Process Group and by Knowledge Area) to end up at the 
        top right where the project (or phase) is then closed.<br>
        <br>
        Each process in 
        the Dashboard comes with Inputs, Tools and Techniques and Outputs for your 
        consideration (to include or not), called tailoring in the PMBOK. 
        <br>
        Remember 
        the PMBOK ver 6 Dashboard with 49 processes and ITTO's is considered the 'best way' to run a project.  PMWay 
        also recommends that projects should be run at <a href="/pin" target="_blank"><strong>Capability Maturity Level 2 
        and above</a> else</strong> "the classic CM L1 problems discussed at the bottom of the PMWay home page" (WAGILE, FRAGILE, AINO (TPM & APM @ CML1 ETC.)) will start to introduce themselves</strong>.</em></h5></td>

            	<p><span class="auto-style4"> These ideas (expanded in the 
			  hyperlinks 
			  and the steps below) involve some degree of lateral thinking, 
			  depending on the depth of your understanding of project management 
				and its processes.<br><br>Often, when running projects in the 
				real world the projects (<a href="../images/chaos-report.pdf" target="_blank">per 
	the Chaos Reports</a>) are simply BADLY RUN PROJECTS.&nbsp; I.e. Project Process is not 
				followed!<br>There is also often little put into place in terms of 
	the initiating, planning or monitoring and 
	controls processes and procedures recommended in the PMBOK or other project 
				methods (PRINCE2 Agile, SCRUM, DSDM etc.).&nbsp; </span>
				<p><span class="auto-style4"> These projects are also allowed to 
				be run at low levels of Capability and Maturity, often firmly at 
				CML1, by an ingorant executive (of project process) who's duty 
				it must be to always ensure that 
				projects are well managed and governance is firmly in place (for 
				the budget / money allocated).</span><p>
				<span class="auto-style4"> In this 
	regard you are invited to think again about RISK and WASTE or scarce 
				resources and specifically about the wisdom from Aesop's fable about the 
	<a href="../cmm.php#justdoit" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert(this);">Tortoise 
	and the Hare</a>.&nbsp; I.e. political pressure to JUST DO IT appears to 
				disregard the step by step nature of project process which 
				should always be managed.&nbsp; This, in a nut shell, is what 
				differentiates professional project management at Capability 
				Maturity Level 2 from JUST DO IT at Capability Maturity Level 1.<br><br>A concept that can assist you to appreciate the 
				above is DDUF, EDUG and NDUF.&nbsp; I.e. in traditional project 
				management detailed documentation (plan etc.) is required up 
				front (DDUF), in the Dynamic Systems Development Method (Agile 
				PM) - the oldest form of agile, enough documentation is required 
				(EDUF), while looser forms of agile require no documentation up 
				front (EDUF).&nbsp; In the PMBOK Dashboard Planning and 
				Monotoring and Control sit on either side of the EXECUTION 
				process group.&nbsp; Dr W. Edwards Deming, the process guru behind 
				the Capability Maturity model has a cycle called the Deming 
				Cycle.&nbsp; I.e. Plan, Do, Check, Act.&nbsp; The Capability 
				Maturity model (from Carnegie Mellon University in the USA) 
				understands that without Project Planning (PP process) and 
				Project Monitoring and Control (PMC) a project is unable to 
				achieve CM Level 2 and is at CM Level 1.&nbsp; There is higher 
				Risk and Waste and lower Productivity and Quality at Level 1

      <p align="left">The Project Management Body of Knowledge 
        Dashboard allows you to easily (and systematically) access the 
        essence of the 976 page PMBOK Six Guide.<br><br>
        This BOK (Body of Knowledge) is 
        comprised of 49 project processes (you can think 
        of processes as building blocks).<br><br>
        These 49 project processes also form connected nodes (on the 
        dashboard) that link up Process Groups (left to right across the top of the 
        dashboard) and Knowledge Areas (left top to left bottom that run down the left hand side 
        of the dashboard). <br><br>
Can you see these nodes and how they tie 
        together the Process Groups and Knowledge Areas of the PMBOK?<br><br>
      <p align="left">So here is the trick:  Underneath each process node (4.1, 4.2, 4.3 etc.) are the process ITTO's:<br>
=> [INPUTS] =>, => [TOOLS &amp; TECHNIQUES] =>, => [OUTPUTS] =>&nbsp; <br>
<b>The ITTO's are like pipes that flow in each process but which also connect to all the other processes!
Essentially, running a project, you can pour effort into the top left process (Four One) and you will eventially (flowing through all the processes) end up at the top right process (Four Seven).</b>
        (<em><a href="/pmboksix/fourone" target="_blank"><font color="black"><u>Clicking here will jump to process Four One and will be able to see it underlying and supporting ITTO's.</u></font></a></em>)<br>
      
      <p align="left">The PMBOK Dashboard allows you to break down the complexity of the PMBOK Six manual from (the Dashboard) and then go into the detail within a process step (for each of the 49 process) and you can also drill down into each of the process Inputs, Tools and Techniques and Outputs (ITTO's).&nbsp; Ultimately, at any 
        point in time while running your project, you should be able to "put 
        a pin" into the dashboard showing EXACTLY where your project is AT, AS AT 
        NOW! <br>
        Ultimately you can also drill down further from each ITTO into the detail found in the PMBOK Guide.<br>
        <br><br>
        <b>Tailoring notes</b> (the ability to make project management sweet, 
        simple, lean and agile) is an essential skill for the Project 
        Management Professional.  These notes can be entered and printed out for each process, leaving an audit trail of how the project is going. <br>
     <br>Ultimately, while BEST PRACTICE is best, BEST PRACTICAL is better!  Leaving detailed notes at each process while I run your project is a practice I always follow.  And it can be used as evidence if I tailor the project, explaining why I decided to go lean on or leave out a particular ITTO.</p>

    <p align="left">Take a look at the PMBOK Dashboard teaching overlay 
        above.&nbsp; <br>
        Now, each time you run a project simply, but systematically, work from the 
        TOP LEFT of the dashboard (down first) and then across (handling each of the processes 
        systematically in turn) move systematically across the dashboard until you end up at the TOP RIGHT of the dashboard 
        at <strong>Close Project or Phase</strong>!&nbsp; <br>
        It is as simple as that!</p>
      <p align="left">You can, if you like, think about pouring water into the top left of the dashboard, into process 4.1, 
        and having this water flow down to process 13.1 and then, up to and 
        across to process 4.2 and down and back up again and etc.<br>
        I.e. both starting 
        processes are in the INITIATING 
        PROCESS GROUP) and then moving this water (flowing across and down the 
        next process group) through all the 
        processes until you have a workable PLAN and DEVELOPED PRELIMINARY 
        SCHEDULE (before moving across to EXECUTION - where you will baseline 
        this as a FINAL SCHEDULE) and Monitoring and Controlling Delivery of 
        Planned Work / Managing Change Control, Budget, Communications, Budget 
        and etc., finally getting to (and out of) process 4.7 (Close Project or Phase).<br>
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h5 class="auto-style2">Know that the PMBOK is not a waterfall! </h5>
      <hr>
      <p align="left">You can move 
        through the processes both left to right and back to left again.&nbsp; 
        Also up and down / from beginning to end 
        of the dashboard.&nbsp; <br>
        I.e. You can turn 
        around and go backwards (against the process flow) when needed when, 
        for example, CHANGE CONTROL (4.6) 
        or other process changes are needed.&nbsp; <br>
        In addition (as you can see with process 4.7- Close Project or 
        PHASE) shorter project sprints are available 
        off the PMBOK dashboard.&nbsp; In this way you can iterate and 
        increment, step by step, towards a final solution.<br>
        This simple fact is often ignored by 
        people who criticize the PMI (and its Project Management Professional (PMP) Qualificaiton), saying it is a Traditional and Waterfall 
        methodology.</p>
      <p align="left">Always remember that while the PMBOK can be used as a method, 
        it is in fact a Body of Knowledge on the best way to run projects.<br>
        In this regard you can think firstly of the PMBOK as a list of 
        ingredients that can be used to run projects and then, using the 
        process groups, a method (recipe) that tells the cook where and when each 
        ingredient should be used.&nbsp; <br>
        In addition, know that PMBOK 
        version 6 is now fully Agile and Lean compatible with discussion in each process about how the process 
        can be used within Agile, Iterative and Adaptive environments!</p>
      <hr>
      <h5 class="auto-style2">Now let us, by way of example, move from Left to Right across (and through) the PMBOK dashboard 
        (project processes) in a little more detail:</h5>
      <hr>
      <p align="left">Essentially, to run successful projects (after you have a Project Management Appointment Form signed and a sponsor 
        appointed 
        [and the sponsor should sign the appointment of you as a PM form!), 
        you must start with either<strong> process 4.1 </strong>(The Project 
        Charter) or<strong> process 13.1 </strong>(The Stakeholder Register) which activities fall firmly within the Initiation Process Group.&nbsp; 
        These two processes must be completed before moving into the Planning 
        Processes.&nbsp; Completion may only need to be at Version 1.&nbsp; 
        I.e. you can always come back and add to and improve your list of 
        Stakeholders and even update the Charter if required. Remember the 
        concept of iteration and incremenation.&nbsp; I.e. using version 
        control you can put 4 stakeholders into your stakeholder register in 
        version 1.&nbsp; Then after a few days you hear about another 
        stakeholder.&nbsp; You add them and update the contact details for one 
        of the fist 4 as version 2.&nbsp; I.e. in this way your stakeholder 
        register is growing and adjusting as you pin down you stakeholders. As 
        long as your sponsor is ok with and approves this.&nbsp; Also 
        approval, while a signature is often required, the simple fact of a 
        typed project log (short record) of what you have done, emailed to the 
        sponsor (stakeholders) and then saved will suffice as evidence that 
        you have 'improved the project documents / project knowledge' on your 
        project.&nbsp; I.e. making your running of the project more agile and 
        lean.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <hr>
      <div class="auto-style2"> <strong>
        <h5>However, and again, do not proceed to the Planning Process Group (from 
          the Initiating Process Group) until these two documents are completed and approved 
          - no matter how much they pressure (bully) you to do this!&nbsp; </h5>
        <hr>
        </strong>
        <p align="left">Remember that in order to get the 
          Charter Signed, one of these internal (core) stakeholders must be accountable and 
          be in the position to kick start the project from a governance 
          perspective.&nbsp; I.e. think bus or train ticket collector.&nbsp; 
          If your charter (ticket) is not punched you cannot ride on this 
          project bus or train!&nbsp; So do not start the journey until your 
          ticket is approved and punched as valid by your sponsor (and their role and authority to punch the ticket is clearly set down in the Stakeholder Register (Process 13.1)!</p>
        <p align="left">To explain this very important PROJECT 
          INITIATION concept further:&nbsp; In the PRINCE2 Agile 
          (PRojects IN Controlled Environments) methodology, a 
          Project Board is responsible for the project and they appoint and 
          manage the Project Manager, who's job it is to serve them.&nbsp; 
          I.e. they must approve the project from a Business Case perspective 
          (that it will add value to the bottom line) before it is allowed to run.&nbsp; They must also approve the 
          project products that the project will be producing.&nbsp; At the end of the project the 
          Board must check and assess that value has in fact been delivered through the project 
          via its project products!</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <strong>
      <h5 >Tailoring and its importance!</h5>
      </strong>
      <hr>
      <p align="left">Remember that 'tailoring' (per the PMBOK guide) means that you must look 
        at each of the 49 processes and decide what you need to do from the 
        perspective of process ITTO's 
        (using your knowledge from the PMBOK guide) that you select (to use and to run) in your 
        particular project.&nbsp; Know that from a LEAN and AGILE perspective the 
        following rule must always apply:&nbsp; <strong>While BEST PRACTICE is understood, BEST PRACTICAL 
        is better! </strong>&nbsp;<br>
        Therefore the SKILL of the Project Management Professional 
        is in the ability to tailor their project towards LEAN and AGILITY!&nbsp; 
        That said, NEVER trade away your ability to land a project safely while 
        responding to pressure you will surely face to make your project go 
        faster!&nbsp; The fable of the tortoise and the hare from Aesop and going 
        off 'half-cocked' is 100% 
        applicable to this way of thinking.&nbsp; <a href="../fail.php" target="_blank" > <font color="black"><u>Some ideas from PMWay on this are here</u></font></a>.</p>
      <p align="left">As mentioned above a tailoring section exists in the dashboard above (if you click on it) for each process 
        where you can add your tailoring ideas (decisions).&nbsp; You then print these out to pdf and save these to your project repository as an audit trail to be used for 
        later reference or as evidence in an audit.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, for the Initiating Process Group first Initiate the project 
        correctly by completing the Development of the Project Charter (4.1) and creating a list of Identified Stakeholders (13.1).</p>
      <hr>
      <h5 class="auto-style2">Then (and this is really important) PLAN the work before you 
        start doing (EXECUTING) the work!</h5>
<p>Agile perceptions about the value of long term planning <a href="/agile" target=_blank">are handled here.</a>  
      <hr>
      <p align="left">Here is something 
        you may not have thought of.&nbsp; Do you know about the Deming Cycle.&nbsp; <a href="../pdca.php" target="_blank"><font color="white"><u>This is PLAN, DO, CHECK and then ACT</u></font></a>.&nbsp; <br>
        Now, if you take a look at the 
        PMBOK dashboard, you will see that it uses exactly this approach!&nbsp; I.e. PLAN EXECUTE 
        MONITOR &amp; CONTROL and CHANGE CONTROL!<br>
        I.e. The quote:  "A goal without a plan is just a wish." attributed to Antoine de Saint-Exupery is worth bearing in mind here.<br>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h5 class="auto-style2">NB: This plan does not 
        need to be WAR &amp; PEACE!&nbsp; In fact, if your Stakeholders 
        agree, it can be a single page 
        long!</h5>
      <hr />
      <p align="left"> I do suggest that your plan follow the Knowledge Areas (along the left side of the PMBOK Dashboard) so that you make sure you cover how you will handle the processes within each of these.&nbsp; 
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h5 class="auto-style2"> Now lets look at how this 
        (PLANNING PROCESS GROUP) works in more detail:</h5>
      <hr>
      <p align="left"> <strong>Can 
        you see that the Project Management Plan 4.2 is the sum total of all 
        of the processes (and Knowledge Area Plans) underneath it!<br>
        I.e. 4.2 =</strong> 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, 8.1, 9.1, 10.1, 11.1, 12.1 &amp; 13.2]).&nbsp; 
        Obviously the SCOPE PLAN (5.1) is the summary of the processes under 
        5.1 which are 5.2 =&nbsp; Collect 
        Requirements, 5.3 = Define Requirements and 5.4 =&nbsp; Create WBS 
        (Work Breakdown Structure).&nbsp; <br>
        If you think in terms of sub 
        plans to create the total plan then 5 = SCOPE, 6 = SCHEDULE, 7 = COST, 
        8 = QUALITY, 9 = RESOURCES, 10 = COMMUNICATIONS, 11= RISK, 12 =&nbsp; 
        PROCUREMENT AND 13 = STAKEHOLDERS will all build up to the consolidated Project 
        Management Plan (4.1).
      <p align="left">Only when the planning is done will you start to <strong> DO THE WORK </strong> as you DIRECT and MANAGE (4.3) project 
        work (EXECUTION) and MONITOR & CONTROL (4.4) the project to ensure that you remain 
        on track with your <strong>PLAN</strong>.&nbsp; Project Knowledge (a 
        resource to pin down knowledge learned while running your project / 
        which can be used to better run and assist with future projects etc.) is handled in 
        process 4.4.</p>
      <p align="left">This 'managing the flow' of processes systematically is 
        very important to ensure you are able to complete the project as you move to (<a href="../baseline" target="_blank"><font color="black"><u>'successfully jump the 
        planned project delivery gap'</u></font></a>).&nbsp; <br><br>

     <br>The key concept (tied to jumping the gap) is that of a project and system baseline. I.e. before you start a project 
        your system or project environment (configuration) will be at a 
        present baseline. The project plan aims, via an approved 
        Business Case, to move this baseline to a new and improved baseline.
        In a system build for example, if the new baseline proves to be a 
        problem then it should be possible to move back to a previous 
        baseline. This concept, and the Capability Maturity Level 2, 3 
        and 4 concept of bi-directional traceability is key.

    <p align="left">Baseline is also used in terms of the project 
        schedule (Process 6.5 - Developed Schedule).&nbsp; I.e. this plan 
        (schedule) pulls together the who, what, when that is needed to get to 
        the new baseline.&nbsp; Typically project management software can lock 
        down the plan into a baseline so that variances against the plan can 
        be used when managing the project.  Earned Value Management is all 
        about bringing the project in on time, within budget and with an 
        agreed scope delivered. While agile will try to circumvent 
        the need to do EVM and monitor and control the plan (Iron Triangle), 
        PMWay suggests that the minute a project starts to run, costs are being 
        expended and delivery (budgets) must be planned and delivered, <strong>or else...<br>
        </strong>
      <hr>
      <p align="left">PMWay suggests that an inability of accounting (and the business 
        driven annual 
        accounting function / budgeting cycle) to adjust to a budget already approved 
        for a project is the root cause for blame for the negative perception of 
        project management and why projects are often run at Capability 
        Maturity level 1.&nbsp; I.e. low maturity appears to exist in this 
        area which insists on everyone JUST DO IT at all costs (CM L1) to 
        bring in a project, even though SCOPE etc., may have changed.<br><br>Why can a project manager not go back and 
        ask for a review of their project budget without fear of an hysterical 
        executive (CM L1)? I.e. At CM L2+ it will be understood that the need is to STOP the bus if 
        the SCOPE changes and adjust the project plan accordingly, which must 
        include an adjustment of the COST KNOWLEDGE AREA (and other associated 
        Knowledge Areas) of the PMBOK Dashboard; leading to a new plan and new schedule. I.e. this 
        schedule is not the old schedule and cannot be expected to exist on the 
        old (approved at that time) budget; else, if the new scope / 
        budget is not acceptable to the executive, then the only other option is 
        to terminate the project!<br>
        <br><br>
        Here is this thinking by means of a clear example:  You and your family decide to drive to a holiday destination.  Then, mid holiday, which is not as great as you expected, you decide to change your plan and spend time with relatives 4 hours drive further along the coast than your holiday destination.  I.e. your plan changes and as driver 
        (head of the family etc.), you, after buy in from your family (spouse, 
        kids etc.), simply spend the extra money for the change in experience, if you can afford it.
      <hr>
      <p align="left">If change in the project plan is required then the Change Control Board (CCB) and your Change Control Process (4.6) 
        is used to ensure the sub plans (which add up to the 
        total Project Management Plan 4.2) are updated to include new deliverables (work packages) in the revised Work 
        Breakdown Structure and Schedule etc., are all in sync with the new (agreed / 
        approved) requirements. <br>
        <br>
        Following the processes the Project Manager will be able to reach the 
        end of the project (per <strong>latest agreed Project Management Plan</strong> and the project can be <strong>CLOSED</strong> (4.7). </p>
