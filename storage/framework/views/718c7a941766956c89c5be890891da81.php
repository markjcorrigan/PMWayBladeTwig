			  hyperlinks 
			  and the steps below) involve some degree of lateral thinking, 
			  depending on the depth of your understanding of project management 
				and its processes.<br><br>Often, when running projects in the 
				real world the projects (<a href="../images/chaos-report.pdf" target="_blank">per 
	the Chaos Reports</a>) are simply BADLY RUN PROJECTS.&nbsp; I.e. Project Process is not 
				followed!<br>There is also often little put into place in terms of 
	the initiating, planning or monitoring and 
	controls processes and procedures recommended in the PMBOK or other project 
				methods (PRINCE2 Agile, SCRUM, DSDM etc.).&nbsp; </span>
				<p><span class="auto-style4"> These projects are also allowed to 
				be run at low levels of Capability and Maturity, often firmly at 
				CML1, by an ingorant executive (of project process) who's duty 
				it must be to always ensure that 
				projects are well managed and governance is firmly in place (for 
				the budget / money allocated).</span><p>
				<span class="auto-style4"> In this 
	regard you are invited to think again about RISK and WASTE or scarce 
				resources and specifically about the wisdom from Aesop's fable about the 
	<a href="../cmm.php#justdoit" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert(this);">Tortoise 
	and the Hare</a>.&nbsp; I.e. political pressure to JUST DO IT appears to 
				disregard the step by step nature of project process which 
				should always be managed.&nbsp; This, in a nut shell, is what 
				differentiates professional project management at Capability 
				Maturity Level 2 from JUST DO IT at Capability Maturity Level 1.<br><br>A concept that can assist you to appreciate the 
				above is DDUF, EDUG and NDUF.&nbsp; I.e. in traditional project 
				management detailed documentation (plan etc.) is required up 
				front (DDUF), in the Dynamic Systems Development Method (Agile 
				PM) - the oldest form of agile, enough documentation is required 
				(EDUF), while looser forms of agile require no documentation up 
				front (EDUF).&nbsp; In the PMBOK Dashboard Planning and 
				Monotoring and Control sit on either side of the EXECUTION 
				process group.&nbsp; Dr W. Edwards Deming, the process guru behind 
				the Capability Maturity model has a cycle called the Deming 
				Cycle.&nbsp; I.e. Plan, Do, Check, Act.&nbsp; The Capability 
				Maturity model (from Carnegie Mellon University in the USA) 
				understands that without Project Planning (PP process) and 
				Project Monitoring and Control (PMC) a project is unable to 
				achieve CM Level 2 and is at CM Level 1.&nbsp; There is higher 
				Risk and Waste and lower Productivity and Quality at Level 1

    			<p class="auto-style2">The Project Management Body of Knowledge 
				Dashboard allows you to easily (and systematically) access the 
				essence of the 756 page PMBOK Guide.<br>This BOK (Body of Knowledge) is 
				comprised of 49 project processes (you can think 
				of processes as building blocks / or interconnected pipes 
				facilitating correct flow of project process).<br>
			These 49 project processes also form connected nodes (on the 
				dashboard) that link up Process Groups (across the top of the 
				dashboard) and Knowledge Areas (that run down the left hand side 
				of the dashboard). Can you see these nodes and how they tie 
				together the Process Groups and Knowledge Areas of the PMBOK?<br><p class="auto-style2">Underneath each process node (4.1, 4.2, 4.3 etc.) are the process: => 
			[INPUTS] =>, => [TOOLS &amp; TECHNIQUES] =>, and => [OUTPUTS] =>.&nbsp;
				<br>(<em><a href="../sitemap.php" target="_blank">Clicking here 
				for 
				PMWay's home page so you can click a NODE and see its underlying / 
				supporting ITTO's.</a></em>)<br>
			<p class="auto-style2">The PMBOK Dashboard 
		  allows you to break down the complexity of the PMBOK from overall 
			project summary (the Dashboard) to detail within a process step (within the 49 process) and then (using PMWay website) you can drill down into each 
			process Inputs, 
		  Tools and Techniques and Outputs (ITTO's).&nbsp; Ultimately, at any 
			point in time while running your project, you should be able to put 
			a pin into the dashboard showing EXACTLY where your project is AS AT 
			NOW!  <br>Ultimately (<a href="../contactpmway.php" target="_blank">as a PMWay client</a>) you 
			are able to drill 
			down further from each ITTO into the detail residing within the PMBOK Guide.<br>
			<br>Tailoring notes (the ability to make project management sweet, 
			simple, lean and agile) is an essential skill for the Project 
			Management Professional which can and should be undertaken for each process.  
			<br>I.e. this is where you 
			keep a record of what you are using of the process (its particular ITTO's), in what detail 
			these are 
			to be used, and what you have decided can be left out.&nbsp;<strong> 
			<br>Remember while BEST 
			PRACTICE is best, BEST PRACTICAL is better!</strong><br><br>Due to the fact that the PMBOK is proprietary for members of the Project Management Institute, access to the PMBOK (the book itself)
		    <a href="../contactpmway.php" target="_blank">can only be granted within 
			PMWay (under my auspices) of which a professional and student 
			relationship is available.</a>
			<br>However, even without my assistance, a wealth of knowledge (I suggest most of 
			the Knowledge you require for the PMP exam or what is needed to run successful 
			projects) is readily available to the casual visitor within this web 
			without you having to purchase anything from PMWay.</p></div>  </div>

	<p class="auto-style2">Take a look at the PMBOK Dashboard teaching overlay 
	above.&nbsp; <br>Now, each time you run a project simply, but systematically, work from the 
	TOP LEFT of the dashboard (down first) and then across (handling each of the processes 
	systematically in turn) move systematically across the dashboard until you end up at the TOP RIGHT of the dashboard 
	at <strong>Close Project or Phase</strong>!&nbsp; <br>It is as simple as that!</p>
		  <p class="auto-style2">You can, if you like, think about pouring water into the top left of the dashboard, into process 4.1, 
		  and having this water flow down to process 13.1 and then, up to and 
		  across to process 4.2 and down and back up again and etc.<br>I.e. both starting 
		  processes are in the INITIATING 
		  PROCESS GROUP) and then moving this water (flowing across and down the 
		  next process group) through all the 
		  processes until you have a workable PLAN and DEVELOPED PRELIMINARY 
		  SCHEDULE (before moving across to EXECUTION - where you will baseline 
		  this as a FINAL SCHEDULE) and Monitoring and Controlling Delivery of 
		  Planned Work / Managing Change Control, Budget, Communications, Budget 
		  and etc., finally getting to (and out of) process 4.7 (Close Project or Phase).<br></p>
		  <hr>
		  <h5 class="auto-style2">But remember that the PMBOK is not a waterfall! </h5>
		  <hr>
		  <p class="auto-style2">You can move 
		  through the processes both left to right and back to left again.&nbsp; 
		  Also up and down / from beginning to end 
		  of the dashboard.&nbsp; <br>I.e. You can turn 
		  around and go backwards (against the process flow) when needed when, 
		  for example, CHANGE CONTROL (4.6) 
		  or other process changes are needed.&nbsp; 
		  <br>In addition (as you can see with process 4.7- Close Project or 
		  PHASE) shorter project sprints are available 
		  off the PMBOK dashboard.&nbsp; In this way you can iterate and 
		  increment, step by step, towards a final solution.<br>This simple fact is often ignored by 
		  people who criticize the PMI, saying it is a waterfall 
		  methodology.<br><br>Always remember that while the PMBOK can be used as a method, 
		  it is in fact a Body of Knowledge on the best way to run projects.<br>
		  In this regard you can think firstly of the PMBOK as a list of 
		  ingredients that can be used to run projects and then, using the 
		  process groups, a method (recipe) that tells the cook where and when each 
		  ingredient should be used.&nbsp; <br>In addition, know that PMBOK 
		  version 6 is now fully Agile and Lean compatible with discussion in each process about how the process 
		  can be used within Agile, Iterative and Adaptive environments!</p>
		  <hr>
	<h5 class="auto-style2">Now let us, by way of example, move from Left to Right across (and through) the PMBOK dashboard 
	(project processes) in a little more detail:</h5><hr><p class="auto-style2">Essentially, to run successful projects (after you have a Project Management Appointment Form signed and a sponsor 
		  appointed 
		  [and the sponsor should sign the appointment of you as a PM form!), 
		  you must start with either<strong> process 4.1 </strong>(The Project 
		  Charter) or<strong> 
		  process 13.1
		  </strong>(The Stakeholder Register) which activities fall firmly within the Initiation Process Group.&nbsp; 
		  These two processes must be completed before moving into the Planning 
		  Processes.&nbsp; Completion may only need to be at Version 1.&nbsp; 
		  I.e. you can always come back and add to and improve your list of 
		  Stakeholders and even update the Charter if required. Remember the 
		  concept of iteration and incrimination.&nbsp; I.e. using version 
		  control you can put 4 stakeholders into your stakeholder register in 
		  version 1.&nbsp; Then after a few days you hear about another 
		  stakeholder.&nbsp; You add them and update the contact details for one 
		  of the fist 4 as version 2.&nbsp; I.e. in this way your stakeholder 
		  register is growing and adjusting as you pin down you stakeholders. As 
		  long as your sponsor is ok with and approves this.&nbsp; Also 
		  approval, while a signature is often required, the simple fact of a 
		  typed project log (short record) of what you have done, emailed to the 
		  sponsor (stakeholders) and then saved will suffice as evidence that 
		  you have 'improved the project documents / project knowledge' on your 
		  project.&nbsp; I.e. making your running of the project more agile and 
		  lean.&nbsp; <br></p>
		  <hr>
		  <div class="auto-style2">
			  <strong><h5>However, and again, do not proceed to the Planning Process Group (from 
			  the Initiating Process Group) until these two documents are completed and approved 
			  - no matter how much they bully you to do this!&nbsp; </h5>
			  <hr>
			  </strong>  
		  	  <p>&nbsp;Remember that in order to get the 
			  Charter Signed one of these stakeholders must be accountable and 
			  be in the position to kick start the project from a governance 
			  perspective.&nbsp; I.e. think bus or train ticket collector.&nbsp; 
			  If your charter (ticket) is not punched you cannot ride on this 
			  project bus or train!&nbsp; So do not start the journey until your 
			  ticket is approved and punched as valid by your sponsor.</p>
		  	<p class="auto-style2">To explain this very important PROJECT 
			INITIATION concept further:&nbsp; In the PRINCE2 Agile 
			(PRojects IN Controlled Environments) methodology, a 
			Project Board is responsible for the project and they appoint and 
			manage the Project Manager, who's job it is to serve them.&nbsp; 
			I.e. they must approve the project from a Business Case perspective 
			(that it will add value to the bottom line) before it is allowed to run.&nbsp; They must also approve the 
			project products that the project will be producing.&nbsp; At the end of the project the 
			Board must check and assess that value has in fact been delivered through the project 
			via its project products!</p></div>
		    <hr>
		     
			  <strong><h5 class="auto-style2">Tailoring and its importance!</h5>
			  </strong> 
		    <hr>
	<p class="auto-style2">Remember that 'tailoring' (per the PMBOK guide) means that you must look 
	at each of the 49 processes and decide what you need to do from the 
	perspective of process ITTO's 
	(using your knowledge from the PMBOK guide) that you select to run your 
	particular project.&nbsp; Know that from a LEAN and AGILE perspective the 
	following rule must always apply:&nbsp; <strong>While BEST PRACTICE is understood, BEST PRACTICAL 
	is better! </strong>&nbsp;<br>Therefore the SKILL of the Project Management Professional 
	is in the ability to tailor their project towards LEAN and AGILITY!&nbsp; 
	That said, NEVER trade away your ability to land a project safely while 
	responding to pressure you will surely face to make your project go 
	faster!&nbsp; The fable of the tortoise and the hare from Aesop and going 
	off 'half-cocked' is 100% 
	applicable to this way of thinking.&nbsp;
	<a href="../fail.php" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert(this);">Some ideas from PMWay on this are here</a>.</p>
		  <p class="auto-style2">The clickable dashboard (Level 2 under the 
		  dashboard) has a tailoring section for each process 
		  where you can add your tailoring ideas (decisions).&nbsp; You can also 
		  print these out to pdf if you have adobe writer loaded on your 
		  machine.&nbsp; I.e. as an audit trail to be used in audit or for 
		  later reference.<br><br>Therefore, first Initiate the project 
		  correctly by completing the Development of the Project Charter (4.1) and creating a list of Identified Stakeholders (13.1).</p>
		  <hr>
		  <h5 class="auto-style2">Then 
	(and this is really important) PLAN the work before you 
	start doing (EXECUTING) the work!</h5>
		  <hr>
		  <p class="auto-style2">Here is something 
		  you may not have thought of.&nbsp; Do you know about the Deming Cycle.&nbsp; 
		  <a href="../pdca.php" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert(this);">This is PLAN, DO, CHECK and then ACT</a>.&nbsp; 
		  <br>Now, if you take a look at the 
		  PMBOK dashboard, you will see that it uses exactly this approach!&nbsp; I.e. PLAN EXECUTE 
		  MONITOR &amp; CONTROL and CHANGE CONTROL!<br>I.e. a dream without a plan 
		  is just a wish.<br></p><hr /><h5 class="auto-style2">NB: This plan does not 
		  need to be WAR &amp; PEACE!&nbsp; In fact, if your Stakeholders 
		  agree, it can be a single page 
	long!</h5><hr />
		  <p class="auto-style2">
			  I do suggest that your plan follow the Knowledge Areas (along the left side of the PMBOK Dashboard) so that you make sure you cover how you will handle the processes within each of these.&nbsp; 
		  If you have signed up with PMWay I have a template that you can work 
		  that is structured according to this method.</p><hr>
		  <h5 class="auto-style2">
			  Now lets look at how this 
		  (PLANNING PROCESS GROUP) works in more detail:</h5> <hr>
		  <p class="auto-style2">
			  <strong>Can 
		  you see that the Project Management Plan 4.2 is the sum total of all 
		  of the processes (and Knowledge Area Plans) underneath it!<br>I.e. 4.2 =</strong> 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, 8.1, 9.1, 10.1, 11.1, 12.1 &amp; 13.2]).&nbsp; 
		  Obviously the SCOPE PLAN (5.1) is the summary of the processes under 
		  5.1 which are 5.2 =&nbsp; Collect 
		  Requirements, 5.3 = Define Requirements and 5.4 =&nbsp; Create WBS 
		  (Work Breakdown Structure).&nbsp; <br>If you think in terms of sub 
		  plans to create the total plan then 5 = SCOPE, 6 = SCHEDULE, 7 = COST, 
		  8 = QUALITY, 9 = RESOURCES, 10 = COMMUNICATIONS, 11= RISK, 12 =&nbsp; 
		  PROCUREMENT AND 13 = STAKEHOLDERS which all build 4.1 the Project 
		  Management Plan.
		  <p class="auto-style2">Only when the planning is done will you start to <strong>
		  DO THE WORK </strong> as you DIRECT and MANAGE (4.3) project 
		  work (EXECUTION) and MONITOR & CONTROL (4.4) the project to ensure that you remain 
	on track with your <strong>PLAN</strong>.&nbsp; Project Knowledge (a 
		  resource to pin down knowledge learned while running your project / 
		  which can be used to better run and assist with future projects etc.) is handled in 
		  process 4.4.</p>
		  <p class="auto-style2">This 'managing the flow' of processes systematically is 
		  very important 
		  to ensure you are able to complete the project as you move to (<a href="../baseline.php" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert(this);">'successfully jump the 
		  planned project delivery gap'</a>).&nbsp; <br>A key concept to 
		  understand is that of baseline.&nbsp; I.e. before you start a project 
		  your system or project environment (configuration) will be at a 
		  present baseline.&nbsp; The project plan aims, via an approved 
		  Business Case, to move this baseline to a new and improved baseline.&nbsp; 
		  In a system build for example, if the new baseline proves to be a 
		  problem then it should be possible to move back to a previous 
		  baseline.&nbsp; This concept, and the Capability Maturity Level 2, 3 
		  and 4 concept of bi directional traceability<a href="../vmodel.php#vmodel" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert(this);"> 
		  is illustrated in PMWay here</a>.</p>
		  <p class="auto-style2">Baseline is also used in terms of the project 
		  schedule (Process 6.5 - Developed Schedule).&nbsp; I.e. this plan 
		  (schedule) pulls together the who, what, when that is needed to get to 
		  the new baseline.&nbsp; Typically project management software can lock 
		  down the plan into a baseline so that variances against the plan can 
		  be used when managing the project.&nbsp;
		  <a href="../evm.php" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert(this);">Earned Value Management</a> is all 
		  about bringing the project in on time,
		  <a href="../irontriangle.php" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert(this);">within budget and with an 
		  agreed scope delivered</a>.&nbsp; While agile will try to circumvent 
		  the need to do EVM and monitor and control the plan (Iron Triangle), 
		  PMWay suggests that the minute a project starts to run costs are being 
		  expended and delivery must be planned and delivered, <strong>or else...<br>
		  </strong><hr>
		<p class="auto-style2">PMWay suggests that an inability of accounting (and the business 
		driven annual 
		  accounting function / budgeting cycle) to adjust to a budget already approved 
		  for a project is the root cause for blame for the negative perception of 
		  project management and why projects are often run at Capability 
		  Maturity level 1.&nbsp; I.e. low maturity appears to exist in this 
		area which insists on everyone JUST Doing IT at all costs (CM L1) to 
		bring in a project, even though SCOPE etc., has changed.&nbsp; Why can a project manager not go back and 
		  ask for a review of their project budget without fear of an hysterical 
		executive?&nbsp; I.e. STOP the bus if 
		  the SCOPE changes and adjust the project plan accordingly, which must 
		  include an adjustment of the COST KNOWLEDGE AREA (and other associated 
		Knowledge Areas) of the PMBOK 
		  Dashboard leading to a new plan and new schedule.&nbsp; I.e. this 
		schedule is not the old schedule and cannot be expected to exist on the 
		old (approved at that time) budget.&nbsp; I.e. else, if the new scope / 
		budget is not acceptible to the executive, then the only other option is 
		to simply terminate the project!<br><br>By means of example:  You and your family decide to drive to a holiday destination.  Then, mid holiday, which is not as great as you expected, you decide to change your plan and spend time with relatives 4 hours drive further along the coast than your holiday destination.  I.e. your plan changes and as driver 
		(head of the family etc.), you, after buy in from your family (spouse, 
		kids etc.), simply spend the extra money for the change in experience, if you can afford it. 		  <hr>
		  <p class="auto-style2">If change in the project plan is required then the Change Control Board (CCB) and your Change Control Process (4.6)
