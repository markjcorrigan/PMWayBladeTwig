  <p>Do you sometimes feel like this?</p>
  <p>If so then read on and learn how to manage all those monkeys
    (a word used to describe &quot;next moves&quot; that you need to manage)
    that are running wild and driving you CRAZY!</p>
  <p>In a wonderful little book called the &quot;One Minute Manager&quot;
    the concept of monkey management was born.<br>
    <br>
    <img alt="One Minute Manager"
                     class="img-fluid"
                     src="/images/one%20minute%20manager.png"
                    ><br>
    <br>
    Essentially a monkey is the <strong>&quot;next step&quot;</strong> in a
    series of steps towards a goal!<br>
    The &quot;next step&quot; is either your responsibility or belongs to
    someone else.<br>
    But if the &quot;next step&quot; is not done then the achievement of the
    goal is delayed or frustrated.<br>
    <br>
    Imagine you are a manager and your staff member stops you in
    the passage, while you are on your way to a meeting. &quot;I have to
    talk to you!?&quot; &quot;Its urgent!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    And before you know it your member of staff has you pinned up
    against the side of the corridor and when they are finished with
    you they walk off happily (with a bounce in their step) and you
    look around and you see the staff member's monkey (problem /
    next step in an action) sitting happily on your shoulder. </p>
  <p> <img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/images/monkeyonyourback.png" ></p>
  <p>They have just made their problem your problem!<br>
    <br>
    In life we all have tasks to do.<br>
    These tasks (jobs) are normally defined in our job description
    or in our role.<br>
    <br>
    These jobs or tasks are our monkeys.<br>
    It is for us to manage these monkeys. I.e. We need to manage
    them and control them (as if they were out very own pets I.e.
    look after them, clean them and feed them) etc.<br>
    <br>
    But many people often do not like their own monkeys because
    they can be difficult to take care of and are hard work.<br>
    <br>
    So they develop excellent skills in passing their monkeys off
    onto other people.<br>
    Especially Bosses and Project Managers!<br>
    <br>
    An effective Boss or Project Manager ensures that monkeys stay
    on the shoulders of the staff members they have employed to care
    for these monkeys. An effective manager does not allow a
    staff member to offload monkeys on other staff members or onto
    him or herself. If a staff member has difficulties with a monkey
    then a manager must help the staff member but NEVER take over
    ownership of the monkey or allow it to jump onto his or her own
    shoulders.<br>
    <br>
    Roles in a marriage can also be seen as monkeys. I.e. a wife
    who hates to cook is always insisting that her husband take them
    out to eat and therefore wastes family money. Or a husband who
    will not manage his monkey of taking out the trash etc. When the
    wife comes into the kitchen and looks at the bin, there sits his
    monkey, chattering at her on the trash bin still overflowing
    with trash!<br>
    <br>
    Children can also become expert at creating conditions where
    their parents feel the need to take over their monkeys.
    Part of the training for life of a child is ensuring that they
    learn to be responsible and to manage their own monkeys and not
    to offload responsibilities which should be theirs, onto others.<br>
    <br>
    If you can manage &quot;your own monkeys&quot; well then you will always
    be assured of a job.<br>
    Managers love staff who are able to manage their own monkeys!</p>
  <p> And here is a trick!<br>
    <br>
    To effectively manage<strong> 'your own monkeys'</strong> always deal with the
    most nasty, unpredictable and potentially dangerous ones first!</p>
  <p> <img alt="Sort me NOW!"
                     class="img-fluid"
                     src="/images/rabidmonkey2.png"
                    ></p>
  <p>In the morning when you look at the many things you have on
    your &quot;To Do List&quot;. Put the two most dangerous monkeys on the
    desk in front of you and deal with them first, NOW IMMEDIATELY!
    Its absolutely OK to procrastinate with the other monkey's on
    your list I.e. the less nasty and dangerous ones. You can
    get to them later when you have handled the two most dangerous
    ones first!<br>
    <br>
    After you have summoned up the courage and handled the first
    two then choose the next in the list from most dangerous to
    least dangerous.<br>
    <br>
    You will be amazed how wonderful you will feel when you have a
    handle on your monkeys.<br>
    <br>
    Try it now! You will not be sorry!</p>

  <br>
  <p align="left"> <br>
    The First Secret: One Minute Goals work best when you: <br>
    - Plan the goals together (Manager and staff / goal setter)
    to
    describe them (staff goals) briefly and clearly. <br>
    Manager must show staff / people who work under them what good performance looks like.<br>
    - Have people write out their goals with due dates on a
    single page each.<br>
    - Each
    goal only a few paragraphs and must facilitate description in
    less than a minute)<br>
    (The staff / goal setter must email the goals to their manager.
    Initially manager works closely with staff / goal setter. <br>
    - Both set up feedback statistics mechanisms (posted data
    etc.
    that can measure staff / goal setters performance)<br>
    - Ask staff / goal setter to review their most important goals each day
    which should take only a few minutes to do<br>
    - Encourage people to take a look at what they are doing
    and see if their behavior matches their goals<br>
    - If it doesn't encourage them to rethink what they are
    doing so they can realize their goals</p>
  <p align="left">The Second Secret: One Minute
    Praising's, when you catch someone doing something right:<br>
    - Praise people a.s.a.p.! (At performance review
    time is far too late!)<br>
    - Let people know what they did right and why it was right. Be specific!<br>
    - Tell people how good you feel about what they did right
    and how it helps the team / organizations effort etc.<br>
    - Pause for a while.., to allow people to feel good about
    what they have done<br>
    - Encourage them (staff / goal setter) to do more of the same<br>
    - Make it clear you have confidence in them (staff / goal
    setter) and fully support
    their success</p>
  <p align="left">The Third Secret: One Minute
    Redirect, if a person has made a mistake:<br>
    From the managers perspective first consider (was the goal clear?
    Achievable etc.) <br>
    If it
    was then...<br>
    - The first half minute (focus on the mistake): The 30
    second Redirect to get a person back on track a.s.a.p.<br>
    Confirm the facts first and confirm the mistake together, be
    specific<br>
    Express how you feel about the mistake and its impact on
    results, the team / organization<br>
    Pause.., to allow people to reflect on how they have done. <br>
    Ensure you give them time to let them feel concerned about their mistake</p>
  <p align="left"> - The second half minute (focus on the person): The
    30 second Reaffirm to:<br>
    Let them know that they are better than their mistake and you
    think well of them as a person<br>
    Remind them that you have confidence and trust in them and
    want to support their success<br>
    Realize that when the redirect is over... ITS OVER!<br>
    (The staff / goal setter can also seek out praise if it has not
    been given (forgotten etc.)<br>
    I.e. Attitude of staff / goal setter must be it will be good /
    bonus if praized, no prob <br>
    / they will break even if not)</p>

  <h3 align="left">From the book...</h3>
  <p align="left">How would you like to work here the New One Minute Manager asked?
    You mean work for you!?  He asked enthusiastically.</p>
  <p align="left">No I mean work for yourself, like the other people on our team.</p>
  <p align="left">I don't believe anybody really works for anybody else.
    Deep down people like to work for themselves.
    The people on our team work as partners and together we look for ways to improve.
    I do my best to help them work better and in the process we all enjoy our work and

    lives more.  And we are a great benefit to our organization.</p>
  <p align="left">This was of course was what the young manager had been looking for all along.
    I would love to work here he said.
    And so he did.
    Over time he benefitted greatly from working with such an innovative manager.
    And eventually the inevitable happened.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Another New One Minute Manager</h3>
  <p align="left">He become a New One Minute Manager not because he thought like one or talked like one

    but because he lead and managed like one.</p>
  <p align="left">He kept things simple.</p>
  <p align="left">He set one minute goals.</p>
  <p align="left">He gave one minute praising's.</p>
  <p align="left">He provided one minute redirects.</p>
  <p align="left">He asked brief important questions.</p>
  <p align="left">He spoke the simple truth.</p>
  <p align="left">He Laughed, worked and enjoyed.</p>
  <p align="left">And perhaps most important of all, he not only managed, he also led people to be

    creative and do new things.</p>
  <p align="left">He encouraged those around him to do the same for people they worked with.</p>
  <p align="left">He even created a pocked sized game plan to make it easier for people to become a New

    One Minute Manager.</p>
  <p align="left">He gave it as a useful gift to those that can benefit from it.</p>
