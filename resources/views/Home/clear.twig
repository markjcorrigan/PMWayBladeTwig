              If you use Self Analysis jump around and ask yourself a few questions each day.  The
              questions start after page 100. <br>
              TThis is called straightwire.  I.e. you are recalling memories from your past hence laying a wire between you now and you then.  Remember that each time you
              answer a question try to look at it from the vantage point of one (randomly chosen) of the following
              perceptics:  Sight
              Smell, Touch, Color, Tone, External Motion, Emotion, Loudness, Body
              Position, Sound, Weight, Personal
              Motion. <br>
              I use Adobe PDF and using (Control F) I punch in a number from 1 to slightly above 500 to get a random question
              [as numbers repeat you may need to click the down arrow to get at same
              numbers in new sections]. The perceptics needed in recall ( Sight
              Smell, Touch etc.) are found on the left or right hand side of each page. </p>

              AAs with Ken Oggers book and Self Analysis above you can jump around here and
              also yourself the questions that are presented.<br>
              However, within the ambit of Auditing, as you can see, the subject is far more complex than that found in self analysis.br>
              The idea is that the auditor and the pre-clear together are bigger than the pc's bank.&nbsp; <br>
              That said, the more you understand about this subject the more you will be able to move towards clear - (as I have done) without an auditor.<br>
