              Sunday Times: 7 Jun 2020 (By BARNEY MTHOMBOTHI)</b></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="black">Gwede Mantashe, the national chair of the ANC who moonlights as President Cyril Ramaphosa's erratic minerals and energy minister, said something the other day that, thanks to the all-consuming power of the pandemic, passed almost unnoticed. "The country will never be the same again," he tweeted. "The economy will never be the same again. Mining in SA will never be the same again. The current lockdown regulations will be applicable far beyond the lockdown period."

              There can be no quarrel with the first part. The country will indeed be different. It will be poorer. The economy will tank even further. Millions will lose their jobs, adding to an unemployment rate already among the highest in the world. Hunger and suffering will skyrocket. And, most distressingly, thousands of our people will perish from this disease. Mantashe is right. What could happen to this country and its people in the coming weeks and months is truly terrifying. The pandemic is obviously to blame, but the pernicious effect of the
              organization and government Mantashe is part of - the corruption, incompetence and sheer ignorance - will exacerbate Covid-19's devastating harvest.

              It is, however, Mantashe's last sentence that is revealing. He states it as fact that the regulations will outlive the lockdown period or the pandemic.<br>
              <br>
              Experts have described some of the lockdown regulations as dubious, if not wholly unconstitutional. Almost as a warning shot, the high court in Pretoria this week declared level 3 and 4 lockdown rules unconstitutional and invalid. Judge Norman Davis gave co-operative governance & traditional affairs minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma 14 days to fix them. The government says it will appeal.

              Mantashe's comments only confirm a suspicion that the lockdown, apart from slowing down the pandemic, allows the government to operate outside the purview of the constitution - and that it regards the constitution as an encumbrance and a hindrance.

              One sometimes gets the impression that the government would be happy if some of the provisions of the constitution were completely done away with. Mantashe's remarks seem to reinforce that view. The constitution is seen not as a cornerstone of our democracy but as an impediment, a hurdle. Rather than championing the constitution and shoring up citizens' support for and belief in it, the government seeks in every way to undermine it.

              Witness the almost obscene excitement with which some ministers welcomed the lockdown and the chance to make up their own rules. The regulations have given them an opportunity to exercise real power, and that seems to have taken precedence over their actual purpose - to slow down the transmission of the virus.

              One of Mantashe's SACP colleagues, the tactless Solly Mapaila, told this newspaper last week that Covid-19 has given the state an opportunity to "discipline capital and the private sector", which he said were at their "weakest". People are dying and all these worthies think about is how they can acquire more power.

              It's quite disturbing to hear people in the ANC referring to business, a significant sector of society, as an enemy. But then, given the way the likes of Bheki Cele address the public, one would swear that ordinary people, too, are regarded as enemies.<br>
              <br>
              But business, not the government, creates jobs. Without business there's no economy and therefore no jobs, no workers and therefore no unions. And ultimately people will starve. That surely is the lesson of the past few months, if any tutorial were needed. A few weeks' lockdown of the economy has seen thousands of people queuing and begging for food. With the best will in the world, the government can never satisfy such demand. Only a thriving economy can.

              The SACP, with its discredited policies, behaves as though the Berlin Wall is still intact. It hasn't learnt the lessons of that epoch. If it had, it would, like its counterparts in the Soviet bloc, have disbanded long ago. It is afraid to submit itself to the will of the people through elections because it knows it will be rejected decisively and that would be curtains for it. It won't take that risk.

              So the likes of Mantashe, Blade Nzimande and Thulas Nxesi sit in government wearing two hats. When Ebrahim Patel, as trade, industry and competition minister, whose portfolio is at the heart of driving economic activity, looks at a range of policy options, which ideological inclination takes precedence? Does he seek to grow the economy or does he see things through his class-war prism?

              It would be fine if he or his colleagues were to apply their class-war mentality after winning an election. That, after all, is what democracy is all about. But the communists are wielding power without a mandate, piggybacking on the governing party.

              The SACP has never been happy with the constitutional settlement, which it regards as a neoliberal arrangement. It wants a revolution. Mantashe probably sees the lockdown regulations as providing such an opportunity.  The ANC should do away with this entryism. In fact the whole tripartite alliance is an anachronism. It should be discarded. Let everyone who desires the exercise of power stand for election on his own merits, not hide behind someone else's skirts.

              The cacophony of discordant voices at the top has led to policy confusion and dissonance, which the country can ill afford, especially in the face of such a dreadful pandemic.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font color="black">Cyril Ramaphosa is currently on a visit to the United Kingdom, taking a good
              look at the place before Brexit.&nbsp; President may have thought he could slip one under the rug regarding the cost of
              state capture.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="black">That has not proven to be the case. Although Ramaphosa told foreign
              investment interests that Mzansi has now stemmed the bleeding from state
              capture, he conceded that a whopping R500 billion ($34 billion) may have been
              stolen during jacob zuma's nine-year tenure. That's not bleeding. That's the
              elevator doors opening up in The Shining.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="black">How much has state capture cost South Africa? That's a heck of a lot of
              money. It's just under half of what zuma wanted to give the Russians in exchange
              for an ill-conceived nuclear power deal. So perhaps we should be thankful?
              Well, that's not going to be easy. Not when you consider we could have spent
              that humongous wad of cash on the following:</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="black">Over 5 000 new state-of-the-art schools. Around 10 billion pints of imported,
              premium beer; that's around 166 drinks each for every man, woman and child in
              South Africa. Almost 20 000 health clinics, fully-staffed and equipped with
              modern technology. Just under five billion kilograms of cheddar cheese. Around
              170 000 new Volkswagen Golf 1.4 litre engine (brand new). 400 million pairs of
              new Nike trainers. Thanks state capture 33 billion litres of petrol. 62.5
              million return flights from Johannesburg to Dubai, so we could *all* replicate
              the Guptas' escape from South Africa. Speaking of Dubai; You could build 12 more
              exact replicas of the tallest building in the world, The Burj Khalifa. You could
              wipe out Eskom's entire debt (R420 billion) and use the remaining cost of R80
              billion to buy the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, belonging to Queen
              Elizabeth and her family. (All stats were provided by linked sources)<br>

          <h3 class="_yntiod">Stabilizing our debt: the hippo in the room</h3>
          <h6 class="_1b0f14t">29 Jun 2020 in News</h6>
          <p align="left">The Covid-19 pandemic and the government's mishandling of it has brought our growing debt problem to a head. How we approach it now will determine what life in South Africa will be like for generations to come. Either more and more people slip into grinding poverty, or more and more people get onto the ladder of opportunity. This is a pivotal moment in our history.</p>
          <p align="left">In his emergency budget speech, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni faced up to this problem: "Our Herculean task is to close the mouth of the Hippopotamus! It is eating our children's inheritance. We need to stop it now!"</p>
          <p align="left">Unfortunately, he did not and could not present a credible plan to put South Africa on a path to debt sustainability and growing prosperity. Credit rating agencies are therefore more likely to move South Africa further into junk status than back towards investment grade.</p>
          <p align="left">We were already caught in a low-growth, high-debt vicious cycle before the government implemented the blunt instrument indefinite economic shutdown. Having dropped from 49% of GDP in 1994 to 22% by 2008, our debt was set to breach 70% in the
          <p align="left">But now the cycle is that much more vicious. Collapsing tax revenues and increased spending needs have doubled the expected budget deficit (the amount by which our spending exceeds our revenue) for this year, from 7% to 15% of GDP. The result is that debt is expected to be R4 trillion, 82% of GDP, by the end of this fiscal year.</p>
          <p align="left">In 2020, 21c of every tax rand goes to paying back the interest on our loans. This is more than we spend on social grants, health, or policing. This number will soon surpass even what we spend on education. The hippo is indeed eating our children's future.</p>
          <p align="left">The minister set out two scenarios, passive and active. On the passive path, we stay on our current trajectory with debt-to-GDP rising to 140% by 2028. This all but guarantees a sovereign debt crisis, meaning we are unable to raise any more debt. At that point, South Africa is either a failed state like Zimbabwe and Venezuela, or the IMF steps in and takes over decision-making. Either way, there's a lot of unnecessary suffering involved.</p>
          <p align="left">On the active path, debt will stabilize at 87% in three years' time and then slowly decline. This requires us to implement economic reforms that enable growth. (I have listed some of these at the end of this newsletter.) No matter how the government chooses to spin it, South Africa's runaway debt is a direct consequence of bad policy choices. It can only be remedied by changing direction on these.</p>
          <p align="left">Genuine commitment and active steps to implement growth-enabling economic reform will increase our ability to pay back debt while also bringing down the cost of that debt, because lenders charge less the more confident they are that it will be repaid. Sustained economic growth is the only pathway out of poverty and towards broad prosperity in a more equal society.</p>
          <p align="left">boweni himself strongly supports economic reform. Indeed, he published a paper last year setting out these reforms in detail. His calls for reform are widely supported, including by Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kanyago, the Democratic Alliance and other opposition parties, business organisations such as Business Unity South Africa and Business Leadership South Africa, economists, international lending institutions, and the major credit rating agencies.</p>
          <p align="left">Yet despite this vast weight of support, South Africa remains on the passive path to debt crisis. The few promises Mboweni did make - zero-based budgeting, restructuring Eskom &#8211; have a high risk of failing on implementation or delay.</p>
          <p align="left">he hippo-sized stumbling block is Mboweni's own party. The ANC remains committed to the failed socialist ideology of state-led "development" that got us into this debt-trap in the first place. In the face of dwindling popular support, the party has been forced to appease vested interests in the ANC alliance &#8211; public sector unions and politically connected business cronies - to ensure its survival.</p>
          <p align="left">The public sector wage bill consumes 58c of every tax rand and this number will rise to 61c if unions have their way.</p>
          <p align="left">Realistically, either reformists unite to build pressure for political change, or we live the horror story that unfolds on the current dangerous and unsustainable debt trajectory.</p>
          <p align="left">The DA is committed to building a country that works for everyone. Financial management is measurably better where we already govern. This week, the auditor general reported that 27 out of the 30 municipalities in DA-run Western Cape achieved clean or unqualified audits. In Gauteng, the only municipality that achieved a clean audit was DA-run Midvaal.</p>
          <p align="left">In the end, voters need to start being realistic about what does and doesn't work.</p>
          <p align="left">The DA proposes the following focus areas for economic reform:</p>
          <div align="left">
            <ol>
              <li>Stem the immediate bleeding by <strong>ending the lockdown and replacing it with a standard set of evidence-based safety rules and guidelines</strong>, where each regulation is directly linked to reducing the spread of covid-19. A standard set of high-impact safety rules will improve compliance and enforcement and raise economic activity. This will protect lives and livelihoods.</li>
              <li><strong>Cut the public sector wage bill over the medium term and grow public sector productivity</strong> by: freezing wages for non-frontline workers for a three-year period; reducing head-office management staff by one third; introducing performance management systems across all sectors; appointing and promoting on performance rather than race, gender or other criteria. The money spent on salaries is crowding out productive investment in public infrastructure.</li>
              <li><strong>Sell or shut down state-owned enterprises</strong> that are not able to survive without bailouts,and redirect the funds to service delivery and social welfare. South Africa cannot afford vanity projects such as SAA or a new nuclear build.</li>
              <li>Make electricity cheaper and more reliable for households and businesses <strong>by ending Eskom's monopoly and opening the electricity market to competition.</strong> Municipalities must be able to buy directly from producers.</li>
              <li>Make it easier to get and create jobs by <strong>freeing up the SMME labour market.</strong> Small businesses should be exempt from the more stringent labour legislation including from agreements reached by bargaining councils.</li>
              <li><strong>Reject investment-killing policies of EWC, NHI, prescribed assets and SARB nationalisation.</strong> Each of these policies may be well-intended, but the real-world result is to scare off investment, capital, and scarce skills.</li>
              <li><strong>Abandon BEE system and target redress policies at disadvantage rather than race.</strong> The DA's position paper on redress sets out the policies South Africa should pursue to remove the underlying inequalities that still exist because of past dispossession and discrimination. Abandoning BEE will make state spending vastly more efficient, which is strongly in the interest of the poor.</li>
              <li><strong>Auction digital spectrum</strong> to bring down data costs for individuals and businesses.</li>
              <li><strong>Reform visa regulations</strong> to enable more scarce skills to enter South Africa.</li>
              <li>Tackle corruption in the private and public sectors by establishing an <strong>independent, well-resourced corruption-busting body</strong> - effectively reestablishing the Scorpions.</li>

              There can be no quarrel with the first part. The country will indeed be different. It will be poorer. The economy will tank even further. Millions will lose their jobs, adding to an unemployment rate already among the highest in the world. Hunger and suffering will skyrocket. And, most distressingly, thousands of our people will perish from this disease. Mantashe is right. What could happen to this country and its people in the coming weeks and months is truly terrifying. The pandemic is obviously to blame, but the pernicious effect of the
              organization and government Mantashe is part of - the corruption, incompetence and sheer ignorance - will exacerbate Covid-19's devastating harvest.

              It is, however, Mantashe's last sentence that is revealing. He states it as fact that the regulations will outlive the lockdown period or the pandemic.<br>
              <br>
              Experts have described some of the lockdown regulations as dubious, if not wholly unconstitutional. Almost as a warning shot, the high court in Pretoria this week declared level 3 and 4 lockdown rules unconstitutional and invalid. Judge Norman Davis gave co-operative governance & traditional affairs minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma 14 days to fix them. The government says it will appeal.

              Mantashe's comments only confirm a suspicion that the lockdown, apart from slowing down the pandemic, allows the government to operate outside the purview of the constitution - and that it regards the constitution as an encumbrance and a hindrance.

              One sometimes gets the impression that the government would be happy if some of the provisions of the constitution were completely done away with. Mantashe's remarks seem to reinforce that view. The constitution is seen not as a cornerstone of our democracy but as an impediment, a hurdle. Rather than championing the constitution and shoring up citizens' support for and belief in it, the government seeks in every way to undermine it.

              Witness the almost obscene excitement with which some ministers welcomed the lockdown and the chance to make up their own rules. The regulations have given them an opportunity to exercise real power, and that seems to have taken precedence over their actual purpose - to slow down the transmission of the virus.

              One of Mantashe's SACP colleagues, the tactless Solly Mapaila, told this newspaper last week that Covid-19 has given the state an opportunity to "discipline capital and the private sector", which he said were at their "weakest". People are dying and all these worthies think about is how they can acquire more power.

              It's quite disturbing to hear people in the ANC referring to business, a significant sector of society, as an enemy. But then, given the way the likes of Bheki Cele address the public, one would swear that ordinary people, too, are regarded as enemies.<br>
              <br>
              But business, not the government, creates jobs. Without business there's no economy and therefore no jobs, no workers and therefore no unions. And ultimately people will starve. That surely is the lesson of the past few months, if any tutorial were needed. A few weeks' lockdown of the economy has seen thousands of people queuing and begging for food. With the best will in the world, the government can never satisfy such demand. Only a thriving economy can.

              The SACP, with its discredited policies, behaves as though the Berlin Wall is still intact. It hasn't learnt the lessons of that epoch. If it had, it would, like its counterparts in the Soviet bloc, have disbanded long ago. It is afraid to submit itself to the will of the people through elections because it knows it will be rejected decisively and that would be curtains for it. It won't take that risk.

              So the likes of Mantashe, Blade Nzimande and Thulas Nxesi sit in government wearing two hats. When Ebrahim Patel, as trade, industry and competition minister, whose portfolio is at the heart of driving economic activity, looks at a range of policy options, which ideological inclination takes precedence? Does he seek to grow the economy or does he see things through his class-war prism?

              It would be fine if he or his colleagues were to apply their class-war mentality after winning an election. That, after all, is what democracy is all about. But the communists are wielding power without a mandate, piggybacking on the governing party.

              The SACP has never been happy with the constitutional settlement, which it regards as a neoliberal arrangement. It wants a revolution. Mantashe probably sees the lockdown regulations as providing such an opportunity.  The ANC should do away with this entryism. In fact the whole tripartite alliance is an anachronism. It should be discarded. Let everyone who desires the exercise of power stand for election on his own merits, not hide behind someone else's skirts.

              The cacophony of discordant voices at the top has led to policy confusion and dissonance, which the country can ill afford, especially in the face of such a dreadful pandemic.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font color="black">Cyril Ramaphosa is currently on a visit to the United Kingdom, taking a good
              look at the place before Brexit.&nbsp; President may have thought he could slip one under the rug regarding the cost of
              state capture.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="black">That has not proven to be the case. Although Ramaphosa told foreign
              investment interests that Mzansi has now stemmed the bleeding from state
              capture, he conceded that a whopping R500 billion ($34 billion) may have been
              stolen during jacob zuma's nine-year tenure. That's not bleeding. That's the
              elevator doors opening up in The Shining.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="black">How much has state capture cost South Africa? That's a heck of a lot of
              money. It's just under half of what zuma wanted to give the Russians in exchange
              for an ill-conceived nuclear power deal. So perhaps we should be thankful?
              Well, that's not going to be easy. Not when you consider we could have spent
              that humongous wad of cash on the following:</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="black">Over 5 000 new state-of-the-art schools. Around 10 billion pints of imported,
              premium beer; that's around 166 drinks each for every man, woman and child in
              South Africa. Almost 20 000 health clinics, fully-staffed and equipped with
              modern technology. Just under five billion kilograms of cheddar cheese. Around
              170 000 new Volkswagen Golf 1.4 litre engine (brand new). 400 million pairs of
              new Nike trainers. Thanks state capture 33 billion litres of petrol. 62.5
              million return flights from Johannesburg to Dubai, so we could *all* replicate
              the Guptas' escape from South Africa. Speaking of Dubai; You could build 12 more
              exact replicas of the tallest building in the world, The Burj Khalifa. You could
              wipe out Eskom's entire debt (R420 billion) and use the remaining cost of R80
              billion to buy the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, belonging to Queen
              Elizabeth and her family. (All stats were provided by linked sources)<br>

          <p align="left">The Covid-19 pandemic and the government's mishandling of it has brought our growing debt problem to a head. How we approach it now will determine what life in South Africa will be like for generations to come. Either more and more people slip into grinding poverty, or more and more people get onto the ladder of opportunity. This is a pivotal moment in our history.</p>
          <p align="left">In his emergency budget speech, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni faced up to this problem: "Our Herculean task is to close the mouth of the Hippopotamus! It is eating our children's inheritance. We need to stop it now!"</p>
          <p align="left">Unfortunately, he did not and could not present a credible plan to put South Africa on a path to debt sustainability and growing prosperity. Credit rating agencies are therefore more likely to move South Africa further into junk status than back towards investment grade.</p>
          <p align="left">We were already caught in a low-growth, high-debt vicious cycle before the government implemented the blunt instrument indefinite economic shutdown. Having dropped from 49% of GDP in 1994 to 22% by 2008, our debt was set to breach 70% in the
          <p align="left">But now the cycle is that much more vicious. Collapsing tax revenues and increased spending needs have doubled the expected budget deficit (the amount by which our spending exceeds our revenue) for this year, from 7% to 15% of GDP. The result is that debt is expected to be R4 trillion, 82% of GDP, by the end of this fiscal year.</p>
          <p align="left">In 2020, 21c of every tax rand goes to paying back the interest on our loans. This is more than we spend on social grants, health, or policing. This number will soon surpass even what we spend on education. The hippo is indeed eating our children's future.</p>
          <p align="left">The minister set out two scenarios, passive and active. On the passive path, we stay on our current trajectory with debt-to-GDP rising to 140% by 2028. This all but guarantees a sovereign debt crisis, meaning we are unable to raise any more debt. At that point, South Africa is either a failed state like Zimbabwe and Venezuela, or the IMF steps in and takes over decision-making. Either way, there's a lot of unnecessary suffering involved.</p>
          <p align="left">On the active path, debt will stabilize at 87% in three years' time and then slowly decline. This requires us to implement economic reforms that enable growth. (I have listed some of these at the end of this newsletter.) No matter how the government chooses to spin it, South Africa's runaway debt is a direct consequence of bad policy choices. It can only be remedied by changing direction on these.</p>
          <p align="left">Genuine commitment and active steps to implement growth-enabling economic reform will increase our ability to pay back debt while also bringing down the cost of that debt, because lenders charge less the more confident they are that it will be repaid. Sustained economic growth is the only pathway out of poverty and towards broad prosperity in a more equal society.</p>
          <p align="left">boweni himself strongly supports economic reform. Indeed, he published a paper last year setting out these reforms in detail. His calls for reform are widely supported, including by Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kanyago, the Democratic Alliance and other opposition parties, business organisations such as Business Unity South Africa and Business Leadership South Africa, economists, international lending institutions, and the major credit rating agencies.</p>
          <p align="left">Yet despite this vast weight of support, South Africa remains on the passive path to debt crisis. The few promises Mboweni did make - zero-based budgeting, restructuring Eskom &#8211; have a high risk of failing on implementation or delay.</p>
          <p align="left">he hippo-sized stumbling block is Mboweni's own party. The ANC remains committed to the failed socialist ideology of state-led "development" that got us into this debt-trap in the first place. In the face of dwindling popular support, the party has been forced to appease vested interests in the ANC alliance &#8211; public sector unions and politically connected business cronies - to ensure its survival.</p>
          <p align="left">The public sector wage bill consumes 58c of every tax rand and this number will rise to 61c if unions have their way.</p>
          <p align="left">Realistically, either reformists unite to build pressure for political change, or we live the horror story that unfolds on the current dangerous and unsustainable debt trajectory.</p>
          <p align="left">The DA is committed to building a country that works for everyone. Financial management is measurably better where we already govern. This week, the auditor general reported that 27 out of the 30 municipalities in DA-run Western Cape achieved clean or unqualified audits. In Gauteng, the only municipality that achieved a clean audit was DA-run Midvaal.</p>
          <p align="left">In the end, voters need to start being realistic about what does and doesn't work.</p>
          <p align="left">The DA proposes the following focus areas for economic reform:</p>
          <div align="left">
            <ol>
              <li>Stem the immediate bleeding by <strong>ending the lockdown and replacing it with a standard set of evidence-based safety rules and guidelines</strong>, where each regulation is directly linked to reducing the spread of covid-19. A standard set of high-impact safety rules will improve compliance and enforcement and raise economic activity. This will protect lives and livelihoods.</li>
              <li><strong>Cut the public sector wage bill over the medium term and grow public sector productivity</strong> by: freezing wages for non-frontline workers for a three-year period; reducing head-office management staff by one third; introducing performance management systems across all sectors; appointing and promoting on performance rather than race, gender or other criteria. The money spent on salaries is crowding out productive investment in public infrastructure.</li>
              <li><strong>Sell or shut down state-owned enterprises</strong> that are not able to survive without bailouts,and redirect the funds to service delivery and social welfare. South Africa cannot afford vanity projects such as SAA or a new nuclear build.</li>
              <li>Make electricity cheaper and more reliable for households and businesses <strong>by ending Eskom's monopoly and opening the electricity market to competition.</strong> Municipalities must be able to buy directly from producers.</li>
              <li>Make it easier to get and create jobs by <strong>freeing up the SMME labour market.</strong> Small businesses should be exempt from the more stringent labour legislation including from agreements reached by bargaining councils.</li>
              <li><strong>Reject investment-killing policies of EWC, NHI, prescribed assets and SARB nationalisation.</strong> Each of these policies may be well-intended, but the real-world result is to scare off investment, capital, and scarce skills.</li>
              <li><strong>Abandon BEE system and target redress policies at disadvantage rather than race.</strong> The DA's position paper on redress sets out the policies South Africa should pursue to remove the underlying inequalities that still exist because of past dispossession and discrimination. Abandoning BEE will make state spending vastly more efficient, which is strongly in the interest of the poor.</li>
              <li><strong>Auction digital spectrum</strong> to bring down data costs for individuals and businesses.</li>
              <li><strong>Reform visa regulations</strong> to enable more scarce skills to enter South Africa.</li>
              <li>Tackle corruption in the private and public sectors by establishing an <strong>independent, well-resourced corruption-busting body</strong> - effectively reestablishing the Scorpions.</li>
