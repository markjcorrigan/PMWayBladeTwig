                  PMWay's 2 cents worth:&nbsp; Think of the past 20 years. I
                  (PMWay) don't know about you but to me it has consisted of a barrage of
                  unproductive negativity from the New South African government against (pretty
                  much) everyone else.&nbsp;<br>
                  In doing this cadres, with absolutely not clue (or
                  formal education), have been installed into positions of power destroying
                  governance and ultimately taking out these structures. <br>
                  This barrage clearly
                  is intended as a form of "gaslighting" to put decent South African Citizens up
                  against the ropes and keep us there while they deliver blow after blow after
                  blow after blow! <br>
                  If your opponent (victim) is up against the ropes (caved
                  in / introverted) then they are not / cannot ask you what you are doing and wont
                  point out that it is wrong!<br>

                  It totally boggles the mind but, sadly, like "ticks" they exist to interpose themselves between Entrepreneurs and profit because they are unable to understand that the scarce resouce is the Entrepreneur and it is the Entrepreneur (the Chef in the Kitchen) that can combine Land, Labour and Captical to business a going concern (work) and not the ANC.<br>
                  And the fact that they do this while using the disaster of Covid-19 to cover their evil intentions simply beggars belief!<br>
                  This technique, used with much success by communists and criminals, is also called "gaslighting" <br>
                  <br>
                  PMWay's 2 cents worth:&nbsp; Think of the past 20 years. I
                  (PMWay) don't know about you but to me it has consisted of a barrage of
                  unproductive negativity from the New South African government against (pretty
                  much) everyone else.&nbsp;<br>
                  In doing this cadres, with absolutely not clue (or
                  formal education), have been installed into positions of power destroying
                  governance and ultimately taking out these structures. <br>
                  This barrage clearly
                  is intended as a form of "gaslighting" to put decent South African Citizens up
                  against the ropes and keep us there while they deliver blow after blow after
                  blow after blow! <br>
                  If your opponent (victim) is up against the ropes (caved
                  in / introverted) then they are not / cannot ask you what you are doing and wont
                  point out that it is wrong!<br>

                  Hello people of South Africa (WAKE UP!) -
                  Look at the &quot;statistics&quot;<br>
                  UNDER THE "AUSPICES" OF THE ANC WE HAVE FINALLY BEEN JUNKED!<br>
                  Take a look at Zimbabwe just over our border, they were also JUNKED by the same forces.<br>
