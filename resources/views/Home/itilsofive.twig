  <p>Access Management has been added as a new process to ITIL V3.

  <p>In ITIL 2011 an interface between Access Management and Event Management has been added, to emphasize that (some) Event filtering and correlation rules should be designed by Access Management to support the detection of unauthorized access to services.
