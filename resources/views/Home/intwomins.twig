                <p align="left">PMWay web forms the backbone for a Masters Thesis investigating Traditional and Agile project methodology, process improvement and the Project Management Information System as enabler. <a href="/cv/mastersdissertationmodel.pdf" target="_blank">The research model here explains this research and approach</a>.</p>
                <p align="left">To undertake this research PMWay has investigated many project methods (standards / frameworks) and approaches. <br>
                  In doing this PMWay understands that Project Management Process application lies in a continuum from Traditional
                  &lt;IRON TRIANGLE&gt; on the right, moving along to Agile &lt;SCOPE TRIANGLE&gt; on the left. <br>
                  <br>
                  I.e. <strong>&lt;SCOPE TRIANGLE&gt;</strong> XP, SCRUM, DSDM(AgilePM), PRINCE2 Agile and <a href="/home/agileoverview" target="_blank">etc</a>., PRINCE2 and PMBOK <strong>&lt;IRON TRIANGLE&gt;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  The concept of DDUF (Detailed Documentation Up Front), (Enough) EDUF and (Little to None) NDUF can help to explain this: <br>
                  (<a href="/home/agileoverview" target="_blank">I.e. click here to the Agile Manifesto and hover you mouse over the manifesto image to understand this</a>).&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  It is also important to understand that the <strong>&lt;IRON TRIANGLE&gt; </strong>which deals
                  with the dimensions of COST, SCOPE and TIME is only a small subset of
                  the many constraints that a project will have to consider.&nbsp; The
                  Knowledge Areas on the left hand side of the PMBOK dashboard above
                  expand the <strong>&lt;IRON TRIANGLE&gt;</strong> for increased coverage.&nbsp; <br>
                  The <strong>&lt;SCOPE TRIANGLE&gt;</strong> removing many of these constraints must, by
                  the release of constraints management, be introducing greater risk.
                <p>Here are the
                  two types of triangles: <br>
                  (Agile / Adaptive Complex Project Management on the
                  left and Traditional Project Management on the right)</p>
                <img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/images/scope%20triangle.png" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/images/irontrianlgemusic.png" ><br>
                <br>
                <p align="left">The Capability Maturity Model, ITIL, Cobit, CMII etc., all support correct governance for process use towards the goal of improved excellence.<br>
                  I.e. Governance - from the Latin <span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 252, 242); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"> gubernare</span>: means "to take the reins" (of a cart with horse or from the saddle) and to steer these for safety.<br>
                  While lean, agility and tailoring is desired
                  in all project types, a balance needs to exist between flexibility and stability for agility.<br>
                  Agile, for example, says that true agility is the ability to balance
                  flexibility with stability.&nbsp; Agile also claims its strengths are being adaptive to change, flexible and able to cope with change. <br>
                  <br>
                  While the Agile Manifesto clearly states value of people over process, <a href="/scrum2p.pdf" target="_blank">the SCRUM method for example</a>&nbsp; has clearly defined 19 core
                  processes within its methodology, each (as with the PMBOK Dashboard
                  above) with essential Inputs, Tools and Outputs. These, if correctly followed (contrary to a culture of &quot;Just Do It&quot;) will ensure the correct application of PP and PMC
                  and compliancy with the Capability Maturity Model at Level 2.</p>

                <p align="left"> PMWay loves agile!&nbsp; DSDM, SCRUM and other method detail is found
                  within this web.&nbsp; However (when discussing agility without software
                  engineering savvy), software design, development and deployment
                  of technology are complex undertakings and according to Brooks "can be regarded
                  as being one of the most difficult undertakings". In Brooks' Anniversary
                  Edition, some 20 years after the original publication of the Essays on Software
                  Engineering, he again emphasized project complexity and why software development
                  projects, to create "programming systems products" can, if not carefully managed, often
                  become mired in ever-increasing difficulties he called the tar pit of failed software projects.
                  [The La Brea Tar Pits are one of the world's best repositories for fossilized vertebrates.
                  Animals would wander on top of a tar pit (which was hidden through dust,
                  leaves, or other such detritus), and become trapped. Predators, attracted by the struggles
                  of a trapped animal become trapped themselves. Hence, fossilized vertebrates in the Tar Pit is a metaphor for failed software projects blundering blindly into serious danger
                  from which they cannot escape.]</p>
                <h5>And if you think that Project Planning (PP) and Project Monitoring and
                  Control (PMC) <br>
                  does not matter for Agile - YOU ARE WRONG!</h5>
                <p align="left">The image of the SCRUM method below shows clearly how and where PP and PMC happens.<br>
                  It is the &quot;BOLSTERING&quot; by PP and PMC of Project Execution that creates the
                  dynamic tension for &quot;hyper productivity&quot; within Empowered Teams which
                  happens at People CMM
                  Level 4.<br>
                  Take another look at the PMBOK Dashboard at the top of this page.&nbsp;
                  Can you see why the PMBOK Dashboard can be used as an effective checklist for
                  any type of project.&nbsp; I.e. Starting at its Process Groups has the project
                  been correctly INITIATED or are we JUST DO'ING IT?&nbsp; What about the PLANNING
                  and MONITORING and CONTROL processes.&nbsp; Are these working to &quot;squeeze out
                  production&quot;?&nbsp; What about the KNOWLEDGE AREAS along the left hand side of
                  the PMBOK Dashboard. I.e. have be started to &quot;Agile,&quot; producing stuff but have
                  not yet obtained the budget sign off?&nbsp; etc.</p>

                  The project selection matrix from Dr. Robert. K. Wysocki  (below) shows one how to decide
                  what project method best suites the type of project.&nbsp;
                  This is based on the criteria of clarity or lack of clarity of the project goal or solution
                  under consideration.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  PMWay's recommended approach is using <a href="/home/agileoverview" target="_blank">PRINCE2 Agile</a> as the recipe you follow; and
                  PMBOK version 6 for the ingredients.  The mandatory use of the PRINCE2 Agile Board (who have the relevant training, experience, ability, agility and power) is the strategic driver for success for the PRINCE2 Agile method.&nbsp; PMWay
                  promotes PRINCE2 Agile based on personal experience of the method's
                  successful use
                  in the Public and Private Sector where he has worked.&nbsp; <br>
                  While PRINCE2 Agile is not shown in the diagram below, being a blend of the two,
                  it would straddle
                  across TPM and APM. <br>

                    It is also important to understand that for Agile to be successful Empowered Workgroups are needed.<br>
                    This, at Level 4 "Predictable," as the People Capability Model below illustrates, is not easy to achieve.<br>
                    I.e. Agile requires training, process knowledge, abilities of quality staffed teams to work well together and many other skills, management support etc.</p>

                I.e. is the Requirement (REQM from the
                CM Model) a doghouse or a skyscraper?</h5>
              <div class="card-body text-center">
                <p align="left"> To appreciate why many software professionals have expressed doubts about agile processes within the context of medium- and
                  especially large-scale software products [Reifer, Maurer, and Erdogmus, 2003], consider the following analogy by Grady Booch
                  [2000]. <br>
                  <br>
                  <img alt="doghouse plans" height="123" src="../images/doghouse.jpg" width="112" /> One doghouse.  A skyscraper of doghouses.... <br>
                  <br>
                  Anyone can successfully hammer together a few planks to build a doghouse, but it would be foolhardy to build a
                  three-bedroom home without detailed plans. In addition, skills in plumbing, wiring, and roofing are needed to build a
                  three-bedroom home, and inspections are essential. (That is, being able to build small-scale software products does not
                  necessarily mean that one has the skills for building medium-scale software products.) <br>
                  <br>
                  Furthermore, the fact that a skyscraper is the height of 1000 doghouses does not mean that one can build a skyscraper by
                  piling 1000 doghouses on top of one another. In other words, building large-scale software products requires even more
                  specialized and sophisticated skills than those needed to cobble together small-scale software products. <br>
                  <br>
                  A key determinant in deciding whether agile processes are indeed a major breakthrough in software engineering will be the
                  cost of future post-delivery maintenance. That is, if the use of agile processes results in a reduction in the cost of
                  post-delivery maintenance, XP and other agile processes will become widely adopted. <br>
                  <br>
                  On the other hand, refactoring is an
                  intrinsic component of agile processes. As previously explained, the product is not designed as a whole; instead, the design is
                  developed incrementally, and the code is reorganized whenever the current design is unsatisfactory for any reason. This refactoring then continues during post-delivery maintenance. If
                  the design of a product when it passes its acceptance test is open-ended and flexible, then perfective maintenance should be easy
                  to achieve at a low cost. <br>
                  <br>
                  However, if the design has to be refactored whenever additional functionality is added, then the cost
                  of post-delivery maintenance of that product will be unacceptably high. As a consequence of the newness of the approach, there
                  are still essentially no data on the maintenance of software developed using agile processes. However, preliminary maintenance
                  data indicate that refactoring can consume a large percentage of the overall cost [Li and Alshayeb, 2002].</p>

                  You know that Project Management Process (Project Planning [PP] in the Capability Maturity Model]) and Project Monitoring and Control [PMC] and Configuration Management [CM] to name a few of the Capability Maturity processes) in system engineering aims to move a business or system baseline forward, under control, towards next stable baseline. <br>
                  Requirements Management (REQM), Verification (VER), Validation (VAL) and others are all processes from the Capability Maturity Level 2 and 3 Process, Engineering, Project and Service Categories.&nbsp; Bi-directional traceability is a specific practice of REQM.  I.e. REQM - Specific Practice (SP) 1.4
                  &quot;Maintain Bidirectional Traceability of Requirements facilitates track and trace to ensure that requirements are installed correctly and that these serve their intended purpose (to realize value).</p>
