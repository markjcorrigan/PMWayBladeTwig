  <h5>&#39;Pin on Stars&#39; when you catch people doing things right!</h5>
  <img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/images/star.png" >
  <p>A neat concept I came across was STAR/AR</p>
  <p><strong>STARS</strong> are &quot;visible proof&quot; of catching people doing
    things right!<br>
    Essentially you give your colleagues STARS if you catch them doing
    something right / doing well in their jobs that is above the norm and deserves notice and acknowledgement.&nbsp;
    And especially &#39;pin on stars&#39; when a good service has been rendered either
    to external (or internal) <a href="/client.php" target="_blank">clients</a>!</p>
  <p><strong>STAR/AR&#39;s</strong> are a way to show people how to do things
    right!<br />
    A STAR/AR is used to inform them of an alternative way to approach
    something.&nbsp; <br />
    While not a reprimand, a STAR/AR is a "redirector"
    recommending an alternative course of action, with you motivating why you
    suggest this.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The STAR/AR system works really well, creating immediate
    improvements and synergies within the workplace as you catch people using
    their initiative, skills and talents to do things right!&nbsp; If people do not do the right
    things STAR/AR can be used to assist to create awareness, for training, and as a way towards process definition and <a href="/home/gamestats" target="_blank">improvements in production
    efficiencies and statistics</a>.&nbsp;
    This fuel&#39;s a positive upward spiral within the individual and the <a href="/team.php" target="_blank">TEAM</a> and
    also between staff and <a href="/client.php" target="_blank">valued clients</a>.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;</p>
  <p>The usefulness within a project team should also be obvious.</p>
  <p>Here it is presented in the detail that could be used to market the
    concept to your staff.</p>
  <p><img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/images/star-ar.png" ></p>
  <p>The above image could head up a STAR/AR form.</p>
  <p>I.e. The form must follow structure of the image above.</p>
  <p> 1.  A place to write the Situation or Task, then the Action and the Result. <br />
    Note Information describing the STAR/AR must include detail in the 5WH format:  Who, What, When, Where, Why, How.</p>
  <p>2.  The STAR/AR (redirector) follows after completing the above detail and should show the recommended alternate 'Action' and 'Result' that could have been followed.</p>
  <p>Once completed the form must be photocopied and a copy sent to the manager, a copy to Human Resources for the staff members file and the original given to the staff member.&nbsp;
    At the time that a staff member receives a review, the STARS and STAR/AR&#39;s
    (in their personnel files)&nbsp; can be taken into consideration by the
    manger / the company supporting the review.&nbsp; <br />
    I.e. At review time a collection of STAR forms in a personnel file can be used by the staff member to motivate a higher score / bonus etc.<br />
    <strong>I would not consider introducing the <a href="/balanced.php" target="_blank">Balanced
    Scorecard</a> without the STAR/AR initiative and process fully defined and
    in place. </strong></p>
  <p> <a href="/Documentssave/resources/starar.zip" target="_blank">An official form and defined STAR/AR process is always best</a></p>
