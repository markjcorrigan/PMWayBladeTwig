<p>Here are a few quotes that say it exactly:</p>
<p> <strong>"Strategy does not separate the good from the great, but execution does" </strong> </p>
<p align="center"> (Collins 2001) </p>
<p> <strong> <br>
  "Execution is the great unaddressed issue in the business world today" </strong> </p>
<p align="center"> (Bossidy &amp; Charan 2002) </p>
<p> <strong> <br>
  "In business, execution is everything. </strong> </p>
<p> <strong>If an organization can't execute, nothing else matters: </strong> </p>
<p> <strong>not the most solid, well thought-out strategy, </strong> </p>
<p> <strong>not the most innovative business model, </strong> </p>
<p> <strong>not even technology that could transform an industry." </strong> </p>
<p align="center"> (OnPoint Consulting, 2006) </p>
<p> <strong> <br>
  "The No 1 challenge facing managers in the 21st century is strategy implementation" </strong> </p>
<p align="center"> (Muell &amp; Cronje 2008) </p>
<p> <strong> <br>
  "60% of strategies are not successfully implemented" </strong> </p>
<p align="center"> (Barrows 2009) </p>
<p> <strong> <br>
  "strategy execution evolved &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; to a top priority in most organisations </strong> </p>
<p> <strong>&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; companies continue to lose 40 to 60 percent </strong> </p>
<p> <strong>of their strategic potential while trying to execute it." </strong> </p>
<p align="center"> (Schreurs 2010) <br>
  <br>
<p><strong>W. Edwards Deming (the productivity / quality improvement and CMMi guru) suggested that
  "as much as 85% <span >of the cost of quality is <br>
  management's problem and responsibility</span>. <br>
  Once it has hit the floor, the worker level, the workers
  will have little ability and control to improve anything."&nbsp; </strong></p>

            follows out that plan, carries a thread that will guide him through the maze
            of the most busy life.&nbsp; But where no plan is laid, where the disposal

            "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.<br>
            "I don't much care where--" said Alice.<br>
            "Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.<br>
            "--so long as I get SOMEWHERE," Alice added as an explanation.<br>
            "Oh, you're sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only walk long enough."<br>
            (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Chapter 6) <br>

            This is also called "Proper Planning and Preparation Prevents Piss Poor
            Performance!"&nbsp; <br>
            In this form it is called "the 7 Ps"&nbsp; or known by its acronym "PPPPPPP". Educators and trainers in military or civilian
            situations find it useful to first introduce the phrase "the 7 Ps". When

          <p class="auto-style12">From the presentation by Dr Anton Olivier from the PMI
            Africa Conference 2015 (found at the top left of this page <a href="/pmi2015/dr%2520anton%2520olivier%2520presentation%2520at%2520pmiafrica%252020150727.pptx" target="_blank">and by clicking here</a>),
            he states that:&nbsp; Strategy feeds Objectives which
            ultimately feeds the Initiating processes of carefully selected projects.&nbsp;
            These value adding projects need to be tightly

            managed via the 9 recommended
            execution components.<br>
            While Dr Anton Olivier's 9 execution components are excellent they are still
            quite theoretical.&nbsp;<br>
            Therefore (I suggest) the question is:&nbsp; How (in the real
            world) do you run projects tightly?<br>
            Answer:&nbsp; Exactly as you do it
            in your (Business As Usual) accounting function:&nbsp; <a href="/pdca.php" target="_blank">By monitoring
            controls on a weekly basis</a> (monthly controls for business finance) to <a href="/ria.php" target="_blank">keep the project driving
            on safely along the
            road (chosen strategic path) it is supposed to be moving along!</a>&nbsp; On a <a href="/epms.php" target="_blank">PMIS / EPMS</a> this (from a Project and Program Management perspective) (<a href="/pdca.php" target="_blank">using
            PDCA</a>) is actually really easy to

          Each time you undertake and do a strategic plan you start with the bottom left
          brick called 'Vision' and move along (left to right, brick by brick [I.e. Vision , Mission, Strategic Intent etc.]), and then upwards to the next row (again moving left to right, brick by brick), and the next row
          etc. until you have worked through each brick and completed the strategic planning process.&nbsp; <br>
          Note:&nbsp; For
          a good wall a strong foundation is required.&nbsp; The essence of a good foundation is explained in step 1 here and in steps 2 and 3 below.<br>

        &nbsp; The Strategic Wall
        -  Note 1.&nbsp; I.e. How you walk the strategic talk!</h5>
      <div id="note" style="display:none" >
        <p>The building blocks in the Strategic Planning Process Model above is taken directly from
          the University of South Africa (UNISA) Strategic Management [STRBESC] Honors
          course - jazzed up a little by PMWay, and represents an excellent overview of the process of
          Strategic Plan Creation Process and how to undertake and manage the Strategic
          Management
          Process for success.&nbsp; <br>
          This Strategic Wall has been in existence in South Africa for over two decades having emerged out of a strategic planning culture that originated during the 'Business Process
          Reengineering' and 'SWOT (Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities and Threats),
          Pareto Analysis, <a href="/cranfield.php" target="_blank" >Cranfield Grid</a> etc. business
          improvement initiatives of the late 1980's and 1990's.<br>
          These would evolve into the <a href="/portprogsimple.php#bcg" target="_blank" >Boston Consulting Groups Growth Share Matrix</a>, <a href="/ec.php" target="_blank" >Experience Curve analysis</a> etc. <br>
          Strategic Planning in the 1980's and 1990's evolved into Strategic Management after 2000 where the planning process was
          seen as a process.<br>
          A recommended text is Strategic Management - Developing Sustainability in
          Southern Africa by Lynette Louw and Peet Venter. </p>
        <p><em>Note:  PMWay has taken the liberty of adding in the last block at the
          top right [PMP and CMMi] of the Strategic Wall.</em></p>
        <p>This we believe, in conjunction with the professional
          use of the <a href="epms.php" target="_blank" >EPMS</a> at CMMi Level 2+, will ensure
          that strategic
          plans will not end up being pipe dreams but will, through tight project
          management and accountability to the "project plan" via [<a href="pmp.php">PMP</a>], be
          successfully implemented!&nbsp;&nbsp;
          I.e. from Formulation through to Implementation, via
          Monitoring of Controls [<a href="baseline.php" target="_blank" >minding the GAP</a>]
          supported by accountable Executive Involvement to the Project Management
          Process (and using Balanced Scorecard, CMMi L2+ etc.) be the only sure way to <a href="/risksiac.php" target="_blank" >limit the Risks of failure</a> and
          ensure success!<br>
          <br>
          This consideration becomes very important when one considers <a href="/tarpit.php" target="_blank" >moving safely through the tarpit</a>.  I.e. when software engineering is concerned!</p>
        <p class="auto-style99"><em> <a href="/balanced.php" target="_blank" />Note:  PMWay's concern about only using the Balanced Scorecard (without PMP and CMMi) to achieve success.</a></em></p>
        <p>The image below clearly explains the concept above and how you can walk the strategic talk!</p>

      <div id="collapse3" style="display:none" >
        <p><em>Often you need to do a strategic (SWOT) analysis first (working the 2nd and 3rd rows of
          bricks in the wall) before you can pin down your Strategic Direction (Vision, Mission and Intent)!<br>
          This is an iterative process of building upwards [often - through environmental scanning and analysis - needing to rework bricks layer by layer] but also understanding that the output of each brick (and the wall overall) will bear down
          upon the foundation:  The Strategic Direction (Vision, Mission and Intent) that lies at its base / underneath.<br>
          Ultimately you must be aware of the vital importance of the 5th row - the strategic drivers for success, <a href="/barrierssi.php">while fully understanding the barriers to strategic implementation</a>.  Also constant awareness of the external factors, like the elements (weather sun etc.) is crucial as they will always be present, affecting the bricks in the wall (the strategic planning process, from inception through to completion) either positively or negatively. </em></p>

                  Implementation</a>.</p>
                <p>With full consideration of the barriers to Strategic Implementation the following
                  additional points are made...<br>
                  The most important points about the correct use of strategic drivers in my opinion are:&nbsp; <br>
                  Your staff are tuned into the radio station WIIFM.&nbsp; I.e. What&#39;s in it
                  for me!&nbsp; <strong>Ignore Reward Systems at your peril!</strong><br>
                  <br>
                  Remember that <a href="/af.php" target="_blank">American Footballers with the important part of their field, looking like a ruler, as a metaphor for CMMi Level 2+</a> <a href="/indexlegacy.php#starttournow" target="_blank">who inspire the PMWay Vision</a> of <a href="/stats.php" target="_blank">upping performance stats</a>, in the NFL are highly incentivized!<br>
                  And 'You are asking me single handedly to do what!  By when!  Are you crazy!&#39;  I.e.  You have to give your people the resources needed to do the job or
                  (guess what) it will not get done!<br>
                  <br>
                  Note:  Per the disclaimer below, PMWay fully supports the correct person being in the correct position no matter their color, creed,
                  religion, sex etc.<br>
                  <br>
                  However, in the 'New South Africa' the new reversed Apartheid of BBBEE is, for any rational person, patently crazy.
                  I.e. a person must be promoted and rewarded based on merit, their capability to do the job and maturity and experience only!<br>
                  A person who has more education and experience (a track record of success in a particular area that requires expertise applicable to that area) surely must be the best choice!<br>
                  To place someone into a position of managerial power that they cannot live up to is a total recipe for disaster.
                  And in addition, due to the peter principle, being overwhelmed, with pressure from below (and with resultant non delivery - from above), this person will lock down the area, blocking all creative activity to protect themselves from below (if incapable and promoted above their level of ability) thus, ultimately they will (<a href="/stats.php" target="_blank">with the down stats they produce</a>) destroy the area / unit / business division
                  etc.!<br>
                  The <a href="/epms.php" target="_blank">EPMS</a> can assist in this regard as <a href="/wbs.php" target="_blank">TAsked Forces working to achieve clearly defined work packages</a> who need to delivery according to clear deliverables and <a href="/etc.php" target="_blank">Estimated to Complete (ETC)</a> predictions can be managed (assuming the manager is aware / has experience of how to manage) to have done so if <a href="/pdca.php" target="_blank">PDCA towards Quality Improvements</a> is allowed to operate. <br>
                  <br>
                  Organizational Structure (or the lack thereof is critical).  I.e. <a href="/crocodile.php" target="_blank">If your organization is
                  bureaucratic and slow to respond</a> do not expect to be a winning organization!<br>
                  Culture and Leadership is also very important.  I.e. do you have a winning culture and are your leaders people you will gladly follow into battle! <br>
                  <br>
                  CMMi Level 2. is about getting this right!</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Also don't forget the critical difference between project tasks and normal, day to day operational work.&nbsp; <br>
                  If you look at the image below this shows clearly that project
                  tasks are not day to day work tasks!</p>
                <p> <img alt="" src="/images/normal%20work%20and%20a%20project.png" /><br>
                  <br>
                  Resources will struggle to focus on Project Tasks if they are expected to
                  hold the line from an operational perspective!<br>
                  <br>
                  This &#39;difference&#39; in focus is clearly shown <a href="/service.php" target="_blank">here</a> and also <a href="/org.php" target="_blank">if you click here</a>.</p>

                  CMMi Level
                  1. (without defined process / project process / an EPMS etc.) can be all about herding cats.&nbsp; CMMi Level 2. IS DEFINITELY NOT!&nbsp; <br>
                  This is really simple.  I.e. if you are playing cricket in a 1 day test <span class="auto-style11">you cannot be asked to urgently leave during the game and help out in a Rugby Test game running on the same day at the same time!</span><br>

                  <span class="auto-style11">You cannot get to CMMi Level 2. if you are doing this! </span> <br>
                  CMMi Level 2. is about process, controlling the cats and putting the monkey&#39;s (MONKEY = THE NEXT STEP) on the
                  backs of the people that need to look after them / carry them / feed them!<br>

                <h3>When project process (the rules of the game)
                  is clearly defined (CMMi Level 2+), and if project tasking takes place on a project schedule that is visible
                  to all players (as a playing field would be) then it is my
                  experience that resources will manage and keep themselves in line as
                  they will know exactly where the 'end zone' is and what is required to
                  get there!&nbsp; I.e. what it will take from them to win the game!</h3>
                <p><br>
                  The simple truth:&nbsp; <span class="auto-style6">Resource allocation
                  issues are a consequence of flawed organizational procedures rather than
                  poor project management practices!</span> &nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  The way you stop this is on the EPMS as all
                  projects with their tasks
                  and the resources responsible for them are centrally managed on a dashboard in one place. </p>

                <p> While the strategic planning process (starting with a clear vision)
                  targeted towards the information above has been focused on
                  project management process, project management infrastructure and

                  Project management process firmly in place at CMMi Level 2. allows you

                  improvement focused projects) towards
                  improving CMMi capability as you introduce the changes you needs to
                  allow you to achieve and maintain high levels of quality, productivity and excellence!&nbsp; </p>

                  required.&nbsp; The best way to proceed if you want to make
                  progress is systematically in a slow upward trend.&nbsp; I.e. a
                  step at a time but getting slowly and systematically better!&nbsp;
                  I.e. improve as fast as you can but without outstripping your
                  reserves or supply lines.<br>
                  I.e.&nbsp; It is pointless to introduce an improvement and after while
                  allow the improved stats / processes to degrade spinning down
                  (from an upward trend into a spiral that improves and then
                  degrades / improves a little and then degrades etc. <br>

                      (CMMi Level 1) and then at <strong>CMMi Level ZERO</strong> it surely

                      indicates no ethics and a criminal intent!<br>
                      <br>
                      CMMi means an increase in Capability and Maturity and effective utilization
                      of&nbsp; resources, which will surely allow South Africa to rapidly receive gains and&nbsp; improvements in productivity and quality
                      (of service delivery provision or etc.) - no matter the type, size or even area of business etc. <br>
                      or if plans are being
                      implemented in the Public or Private sector.<br>

                    <p align="center">&#39;CMMi&#39; and &#39;Minding the Gap&#39; is PMWay&#39;s solution to solving the
                      above problem.&nbsp; <br>
                      I.e. Projectize and allocate
                      resources to your projects up front before you

                      start, then baseline your
                      delivery gap and drive for quality DELIVERY!<br>
                      <br>
                      In South Africa (and elsewhere in the world) projects are an excellent way to pool
                      scarce resources <br>
                      towards the implementation and achievement of project or <a href="/strategy.php" target="_blank">strategic</a> goals.<br>
                      <br>
                      Failure to implement <a href="/continuity.php" target="_blank">consistently</a> from a project management process perspective is simply because the <a href="/irontriangle.php" target="_blank">IRON TRIANGLE</a> is not being
                      tightly managed.<br>
                      Essentially this (from a human resources perspective) means <a href="/wbs.php" target="_blank">TASKING</a> competent human resources (WHO) to do WHAT with WHAT and deliver by WHEN.</p>
                    <p>While not the only reason, it is self evident that in the New Post Apartheid
                      South Africa,
                      with the fast tracking of the previously disenfranchised <br>
                      (Cadre deployment [I.e.
                      loyalty ahead of competence] by the ANC into positions of influence / BBBEE
                      [perceived as many as the New South African Apartheid?] etc.) <br>
                      an attitude of entitlement exists which has also unfortunately resulted in a
                      degradation in moral standards and the disruption of the work ethic in
                      government (municipalities etc.) and business.&nbsp;<br>
                      <br>
                      The above has negatively affected the ability of the ANC to deliver
                      quality services to all people in South Africa (as the golden goose is
                      being killed for its eggs exactly as was done by President Robert Mugabe
                      on his &#39;Radical Socialist&#39; ticket in Zimbabwe [a classic example
                      of a destructive while self serving (for Mugabe and loyal supporters)
                      totally incompetent CMMi Level ZERO dictatorship]).&nbsp; <br>
                      This has seriously tarnished the Vision of Nelson Mandela and his concept of a clean slate
                      from 1994 / forgiveness for all / the unified and color blind Rainbow
                      nation that a New South Africa can become.<br>
                      The short book Animal Farm by George Orwell clearly explains the self
                      serving, unethical and destructive &#39;syndrome&#39; at work.<br>
                      <br>
                      The above
                      (in this webmasters opinion) is
                      at the forefront of South Africa&#39;s service delivery woes!&nbsp; <br>
                      I.e. In essence; A LACK AND INABILITY OF
                      PROFESSIONAL MANAGERS to TASK RESOURCES and HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR PRODUCTION AND
                      QUALITY DELIVERY!</p>

                      <em><span class="auto-style99">George Orwell in his deeply ironic little book: Animal Farm, succinctly says it all.</span></em></p>
                    <p>CMMi Level 2. is surely the solution!&nbsp; CMMi at level 2. can be
                      further empowered
                      by the Microsoft Enterprise Project Server (2013) [or similar project
                      management system] which ensures that all human
                      resources created within the system (via online / real-time / internet 'GLOBAL'
                      'CLOUD BASED' connectivity) enables the WHO, agreeing to do WHAT while understanding that
                      they must deliver.&nbsp; I.e. update their
                      TASK delivery
                      status on a regular basis on the project system during and by the delivery
                      date.&nbsp; This
                      (technology) enables the project manager who is now able to manage human
                      resources that are situated anywhere (connected to the server [project] via
                      the internet), to
                      &#39;monitor and control&#39; project delivery at a level not available
                      previously.<br>
                      <br>
                      This ensures that &#39;capable human
                      resources&#39; who have agreed to do work must now deliver this in time so that this work
                      can be quality checked.&nbsp; <br>
                      From a <a href="/governance.php" target="_blank"> well run project and accounting governance</a> perspective (comparing actual
                      delivery against the project plan / planned delivery) this means
                      excellence can be driven towards and achieved!<br>
                      <br>
                      From the point of view of overall resource utilization a project that is
                      well planned and consistently delivers what has been planned <a href="/transparency.php" target="_blank">equates to
                      total transparency</a> in the utilization of the scarce resources which
                      can be seen in consistent delivery of quality solutions to the valued client - whomever they
                      may be.&nbsp; <br>
                      <br>
                      I put it to you than ONLY WHEN you
                      are able to exhibit project control to this extent can you can say you are now
                      operating at CMMi Level 2!<br>
                      CMMi
                      focused Level 2 projects can then also be used to drive quality into operations per
                      the guidelines of CMMi to achieve higher productivity and quality for each
                      level.</p>

                    As did our ex President Thabo Mbeki in 2013, re service delivery challenges,
                    a lack of governance and the urgent need for excellence;
                    PMWay also issues a challenge to those responsible for the allocation and spending of our tax budget to 'up your game!'</h5>
                  <div id="collapse102" style="display:none" >
                    <p>A University research paper at honors level has been written by the author of this web, dealing with this burning issue in South Africa of a lack of governance, rampant corruption and the very serious service delivery problems
                      caused, in Government, by operating at CMMi Level Zero and 1 in our Country. <a href="mailto:mark@pmway.co.za?subject=hi please let me have a download link to the research paper about cmmi within south africa that you refer to.">This research paper is available via an email request to the webmaster if you click here</a>.  The paper (fully hyperlinked into the PMWay web site) attempts to illustrates how the CMMi model (from Carnegie Mellon University in the United States of America)
                      applying (Capability and Maturity improvements) towards a minimum of a stable CMMi Level 2. can be used to immediately halt corruption and which will immediately begin to solve service delivery problems in South Africa.<br>
                      While Capable, mature, intelligent, educated people with integrity are required to implement CMMi at an executive level: (<a href="/ei.php" target="_blank">I.e. Authentic Leaders - more about this in the 'Emotional Intelligence to Authentic Leadership' TAB of PMWay</a>) the author believes that CMMi is the path to travel to arrive 'most quickly' at the point where productivity and quality (in this case from a service delivery perspective) are vastly improved. <br>
                      <br>
                      This Honors level research paper received a University first class distinction as forms a good base for further research on the subject.
                      The author has been accepted into a masters degree and is currently busy with at a masters level thesis; focusing primarily on the futility of Agile ('an apparent panacea'
                      sought by Government, when PMBoK processes are not followed correctly) at CMMi Level 1.<br>
                      As a teaser, if interested, check out this page in PMWay dedicated to <a href="/chefnotcook.php" target="_blank">Robert K. Wysocki's Adaptive Complex Project Management process</a> - ground breaking stuff. <br>
                      I.e. CMMi Level 3 risk management capability (RSKM) [based on a stable CMMi Level 2 process base] is required to successfully implement APM (Agile Project Management) which is often seen by many as an instant way to bypass the <a href="/tarpit.php" target="_blank">many software engineering challenges that lie in wait in the tarpit</a>. <br>
                      Soundly defined and then followed processes, be it PMBoK&reg;, PRINCE2, or etc. is the only way to succeed in the tarpit!</p>
                    <p>More to follow on this with the research completed after 2016.</p>
