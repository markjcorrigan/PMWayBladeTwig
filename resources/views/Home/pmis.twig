<h5>The 'Direct and Manage Project Work' Process #4.3<br>
  (Project Integration Knowledge Area) from the PMBOK&reg; Guide <br>

<p class="auto-style3">Note:&nbsp; The Project Management Information
  System (PMIS) in the PMBOKÂ® is called the Enterprise Project Management
  Server (EPMS) in PMWay. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is PMWay's
  considered opinion that you cannot achieve CMMi Level 2+ without this
  essential Tool and Associated Techniques that the EPMS enables.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few
  examples (illustrated below) are:&nbsp; Human Resource Pool Management - <a href="/wbs.php" target="_blank">TAsking (Time
  Asking) by the hour</a>, Team Collaboration, Web Access, Base lining
  schedules, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slip lines on
  slipped tasks, <a href="/gate.php" target="_blank"> Stage Gate</a> / Program Management, <a href="/ria.php" target="_blank">Risk and Issue
  Management</a> via collaboration engine, and the big one: <a href="/evm.php" target="_blank">Earned Value
  Management</a> etc.</p>

<h5>Project Time Management (coordinated with other knowledge areas in the PMBOK) is where the EPMS 'rubber
  really hit the road!'&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you see it?</h5>

        <h5>The Microsoft Enterprise Project Management Server System (an EPMS PMWay
  recommends) is actually a
  very simple tool:&nbsp; </h5>
        <p class="auto-style4"> <img alt="" class="img-fluid"  src="/images/self-parking-garage1.jpg" ></p>
        <p>Read these 3 key points below to understand exactly what the Microsoft EPMS is:</p>
        <ul>
  <li>Everyone should know Microsoft Project Professional (MSP) client.  I.e. the project software that runs on a single computer.&nbsp;
            If not there are literally thousands of books / video's / courses that
            explain how to use this excellent and mature software project management
            tool! </li>
  <li>Microsoft's Enterprise Project Management Server System (EPMS) is simply Microsoft Project
            for the individual (described above) but now as a storage and management
            repository for many projects in a client server environment.&nbsp;
            You can think of the EPMS as a storage warehouse (with extensive
            reporting and management tools telling you everything you need to know
            about the status (on an ongoing basis / on demand) of your warehouse).&nbsp; I.e. exactly what your
            current stock
            levels are per stock item, re-order points etc. But instead of stock
            reports the EPMS will
            be able to provide information about projects status of all projects in the EPMS
            projects repository / warehouse.&nbsp; <br>
            Just as you would use MS Project on your own computer, now, with the
            EPMS, you simply save it to the EPMS server (for centralized storage and
            management) and then re-open it from the server when you want to work on
            it again.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>As an alternative you can also use the web based view of what is in the
            EPMS server called PWA (Project Web Access) to connect to and view / manage
            parts of your project
            plan.&nbsp; Being web based PWA has strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp; I.e.
            you can do certain things quickly and easily - update tasks, view to-do
            lists, manage issues and lists, view documents, view reports etc. if you
            are connected to the server via an internet browser.&nbsp; This is a
            lite version of the original MSP and has advantages and disadvantages
            depending on what you aim to achieve.&nbsp; For myself, I like to use
            the MSP application (book the projects I am working on in and then book
            them out of the EPMS) when working on a project within the EPMS client
            server environment.&nbsp; While PWA can be accessed via the Intranet / Internet not
            many companies are happy to expose their information (the project server)
            unless adequate security is in place to ensure their data remains safe and confidential.<br>
            NOTE:&nbsp; With EPMS 2013 Microsoft have now fully enabled their
            project server for Cloud
            Computing.&nbsp; <br>
            This means that via PWA, resources will now be able to
            connect from anywhere there is an internet connection.&nbsp; Also
            project servers can be hosted anywhere in the world by 3rd parties.&nbsp;
            The advantages for specialization (remotely hosted servers maintained by
            specialists who administrate the machines well), remote access (all
            resources simply jump onto the internet and update their tasks) and <span class="auto-style2">Project Monitoring and Control</span> are
            now incredibly advanced! <br>
            <br>
            NOTE:&nbsp; Microsoft are also moving Visual Studio, Enterprise Project
            Management Server, Team Foundation Server (via SharePoint) closer
            together to further enable Productivity and Quality in the Software
            Project (or other type) Management Arena.<br>
            <p>The above said, incredible advantages can be obtained by centralizing Microsoft Project into a
      Client Server environment - as a read below will elucidate.&nbsp; <a href="project%20documents/epm%20solution%20guide.pdf" target="_blank">First read the EPMS 2010 overview as this is the essence</a>, then read further
      down the page for PMWay observations on how the EPMS can be used to "beef" up your business
      plans, project office etc. towards sustained and quality delivery.<br>
      &nbsp;<em>&nbsp;<br>
              (Note:&nbsp;
              While I fully support Microsoft's EPMS as it (2010 version) has now come of age, if another Enterprise Project Management System can offer the
              same or better advantages then please feel free to use this!&nbsp; I.e. PMWay's interest
              in Microsoft's EPMS is not a vested one!&nbsp; <br>
              I (as I am sure do you)
              simply want to get the job done with the best toolset available at
              the moment. PMWay is not about promoting a certain toolset over another, but rather about
              "getting at" the essence of Enterprise Project Management / Projectization.&nbsp;
              I.e. CMMi Level 2. (which is <strong>"projects correctly managed"</strong>) <strong>PMWay strongly believes can only be achieved on an EPMS!</strong>&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Conversely, without an EPMS, the CMMi Level 2 requirements and the necessary project office
              / project management controls that are offered by the EPMS (I.e.
              Central control that is online and in real time including but not
              limited to tight
              Project
              Management (off centrally control baselines, centrally controlled and
              co-ordinated resource management, team collaboration, business level project
              /
              program and portfolio management (tied to <a href="strategy.php" target="_blank">strategic direction</a> for the company), rubber

              the job done!&nbsp; Due to this, the only way to be sure of Project Success
              (time and time again per CMMi Level 2.) is
              with a centrally controlled Project Office running on an EPMS.&nbsp; Without the governance and central control offered by a
              Project Office running off an EPMS success in projects will be highly
              questionable, no matter how excellent a project manager you are!&nbsp;

            <p> &nbsp;-&nbsp; Manage the Global Resources pool within the EPMS.&nbsp; I.e.
              which resource (name / skill / rate per hour etc.) is assigned to what project, when and for how many hours,
              and on which
              particular days.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              <a name="task"></a>Remember that for tasks, while we can work on % Complete, we
              should actually use the full power of the EPMS and manage staff on
              actual delivery time spent against estimated (agreed by the resource)
              delivery time.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Resource:&nbsp; "Yes I agree to do X task spending four full days at 8 hours and can have the task completed by 12PM next Thursday." <br>
              Project Manager:  "Excellent!  Are you happy to sign off the schedule so I can sign off your commitment? <br>
              I need this as part of the sign off on the project to move through our
              stage gate and fully into Execute Phase.  I.e. to enable me to instruct the project office to apply the project baseline
              to our project on the EPMS server.  If you sign off, with all the other
              resources having signed off, we&nbsp; will be good to go!" <br>
              <br>
              As the Project Manager has to agree that tasks are completed when using the EPMS.  I.e. the resource completes the task (or X hours of work within a task on a particular day) and for the task to be fully completed the other leg of the completion must be agreed to by the Project Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              This is called a SUBMIT / ACK (ACK=Acknowledged).&nbsp; I.e. I submit my completed time in
              EPMS to the Project Manager and he then ticks that he has accepted this
              I.e. ACK's it as ok.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              During the SUBMIT / ACK cycle it is a very good time to CHECK THE QUALITY OF THE WORK!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              I.e. "I want to sign off your task.  Please show me what you have done."</p>

            <p>I.e. with the EPMS, via weekly (or more frequent minutes) the PM can
              keep accurate project status and quickly escalate problems that cannot be solved by the project team.&nbsp; <a href="sponsor.php" target="_blank">Click here</a> for the importance

            <p> - <a href="tolerance.php" target="_blank">Base lining a project </a>gives us a wealth of information on project progress and status
              (health). <br>
              <br>
              It must be born in mind that a project schedule (the plan as a Gantt Chart above is an example), once baselined, runs directly above the invisible
              FROZEN (in time) COPY (baseline) of itself (there can also be many baselines saved at various times during the life of a project).  Numerous standard or custom EPMS reports are available / can be created (including EPMS dashboards) which use the % difference between where a task is in relation to the baseline of that same task
              baseline is over time.&nbsp;  If a task is over an agreed variance in relation to its baseline then it will show up as a
              positive or negative variance (also color coded images can be used I.e.
              green smiley face means task on track, neutral face with an amber color (task
              late) or
              sad face in red (task very late)) within agreed parameters off the
              latest saved baseline. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>The way the EPMS is supposed to work, when administrated from a Project Office, is that tasks not completed at the end of the week must be pushed forward to the next week!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              (think of this as a week end reconciliation similar to a month end in
              bookkeeping / accounting) <br>
              This can be achieved at a click of a button on Microsoft Project.<br>
              <br>
              At the end of the week (weekend EPMS administration) project timesheets
              are completed and submitted [forcing Project Managers to ACK tasks for
              final completion], resources paid and the EPMS system reporting is
              produced for the weekend status reporting.</strong><br>
              <br>
              This is an extremely important process because this forced moving forward of unfinished work means that variance against baseline will quickly become visible if work is not completed
              on time!&nbsp; <br>
              Examples of calculations used, if you are interested, can be found if you <a href="project%20documents/slippage%20formules.doc" target="_blank">click here</a>.&nbsp;
              The calculation may, at first&nbsp; appear to the uninitiated as being
              quite complicated.&nbsp; However, these are the typical calculations that are used to calculate variance off baseline allowing tighter management of the IRON TRIANGLE
              quality dimensions that are crucial to Project Management Process [PMP].&nbsp;&nbsp;  (If you are confused about
              the calculation you are welcome to contact me via email for more information or advice).&nbsp;  Remember that these
              calculations (customizable per installation) are set up in the EPMS when the installation is first created and, once in place, are always accessible as long as the project has been baselined.&nbsp;
              This is because all project progress calculations
              are fundamentally dependent on the project baseline as the base from which actuals are worked out. <br>
              <br>
              This is the reason why, from a project office administration point of
              view, we insist, within the PMWay model that a project charter be signed off and the project schedule baselined
              [<a href="gate.php" target="_blank">AS A "GO/NO GO" STAGE GATE</a>] at the end of the Planning Phase.

            <p> Successfully compiling the signed off Project Charter (with all key
              documents including WBS / Gantt etc. as annexures) sets up the EPMS environment so that
              the Project Office administrator can <a href="baseline.php" target="_blank">baseline the gap </a>and the project
              manager and team can now JUMP THE GAP!

            <p> -  In addition Project Management dashboards and Project Office / Executive reports are a breeze off the EPMS.

              &nbsp;-&nbsp; In addition Project Management dashboards and Project Office /
              Executive reports are a breeze off the EPMS and easy to use for project
              resources, managers and project office administrators.&nbsp;&nbsp; For
              example here is the web based Project Center available to the project
              manager and resources (if they have access) giving them an overview of
              the projects they have rights to see.

            <p> Remember that you can <strong>take it slow</strong> when implementing an
              EPMS in your company.&nbsp; <br>

            <p> <strong>THE EPMS, LIKE A FINANCIAL OR ACCOUNTING CONTROL SYSTEM, IS A
              PROJECT CONTROL SYSTEM!<br>
              </strong><a href="feather.php" target="_blank"> <img alt="" class="img-fluid"  src="/images/featherorhard.png" ></a></p>
            <p >

            <p> Here are some first steps:</p>
            <p> 1.&nbsp; Get a trained project server administrator on board!&nbsp; An
              experienced EPMS consultant can also assist you to implement the EPMS
              towards institutionalizing the system within your environment.</p>
            <p>2.&nbsp; Then I advise implementing an EPMS as a simple repository of
              project plans at first.&nbsp; I.e. Just use it initially as a central
              warehouse where project plans can be stored and kept safe (I.e. from a
              custodianship point of view).&nbsp;
              In this phase you can teach users how to upload and download their plans.&nbsp; I.e. create
              the resource pool and link people to the server.&nbsp; Remember that a
              plan can be downloaded from the server and run stand alone on a laptop.&nbsp;
              However, to update the server with the updated / changed project plan
              the Project Manager will have to sign up to the server again and safe
              the new plan to the server.&nbsp; HERE IS THE THING!&nbsp; If you do not
              publish your project plan back to the server then the server is out of
              whack with your plan.&nbsp; Therefore a regular upload cycle must be
              implemented.&nbsp; The way to do this is to have a week end (or week
              beginning) CUT OFF for reporting.&nbsp; To prepare for this Project
              Managers (and resources they are managing) must do a week end and finish
              updating tasks etc. in preparation for the publish to the EPMS.&nbsp;
              Only at this time can the Project Management Office (PMO) produce
              weekend reports.&nbsp; <a href="feather.php" target="_blank">Just like
              a financial system that needs to do month end or year end.</a>&nbsp;
              Remember Project Plans are about INVESTED MONEY and are just as
              important as accounting books.&nbsp; It is vital for a company to be
              able to know when the benefit it has invested is no longer worth the
              cost of the investment!&nbsp; Obvious is it not! </p>
            <p>3.&nbsp; Then move towards creating a structure within the EPMS
              outline codes that will tie projects to the phases of the Project
              Management Process:&nbsp; I.e. Initiate, Plan, Execute, Close etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>4.&nbsp; Then (with small projects at first) move towards base lining
              plans on the server towards tighter control / delivery against the agreed baseline.&nbsp;
              This is a big and quite difficult step!&nbsp; I.e. moving from CMMi
              Level 1. to CMMi Level 2!&nbsp; The administrator should be able to show project managers how to manage
              their projects using slippage of tasks reports etc.&nbsp; Then I suggest
              that weekly meetings be held where plans are shown to all resources via overhead presentation.&nbsp;
              This will be off the EPMS server (as the server contains (or should
              contain) the latest / most up to date plan), to the project team, at weekly project
              meetings.&nbsp; I.e. actual delivery in the plan is seen against its
              baseline and slipping tasks / resources / the Project Manager are held accountable.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>5.&nbsp; The use of
              project minutes must be used and all <a href="risksiac.php" target="_blank">issues from risks</a> placed
              immediately in the minutes as actions for accountable resources to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="mm.php" target="_blank">Put the monkey</a> on the backs of
              those who must manage them, and ensure the task (or issues etc.) gets
              sorted out / dusted.&nbsp; Even if it is a manager or the CEO!&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The vital importance of an <a href="sponsor.php" target="_blank"> empowered sponsor</a> has been shown in the Lemmings project above!&nbsp; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;6.&nbsp; Then
              systematically (a step at a time) start to empower the project office
              with more and more functionality as you decide what is essential for
              successful project management and what additional functionality can be
              added in phase 2, 3 etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; IT IS NOT ABOUT HOW FANCY YOUR
              BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE / REPORTS ARE!&nbsp; A FEW KEY REPORTS (FOR
              EXAMPLE), IF THEY HELP YOU <a href="baseline.php" target="_blank"> SUCCESSFULLY JUMP THE GAP</a>, ARE ALL YOU NEED!</p>
            <p>7.&nbsp; There is obviously a lot more you can do.&nbsp; Here is a
              final tip to help you with CMMi.&nbsp; Create CMMi Governance Plans
              alongside each of your project plans in the EPMS.&nbsp; These "mini
              plans" (you can separate them from the normal projects in all PWA views
              I.e. create their own area within the EPMS) will ensure that CMMi
              "artifacts" like Project Charters etc. are delivered "signed and
              scanned" to the Project Management Office (PMP) and then "secured" within
              the PMO document repository.&nbsp; When you have a CMMi <strong>SCAMPI </strong>(<strong>S</strong>tandard <strong>C</strong>MMi <strong>A</strong>ppraisal <strong>M</strong>ethod for <strong>P</strong>rocess <strong>I</strong>mprovement)
              audit this checklist will really help you.&nbsp; And each time you
              create a new project in the EPMS it creates a Web Site along with it.&nbsp;
              Use each CMMi mini plan's web to secure all project documentation for
              use within the Project Management Approach I.e. can I move through gate
              1. etc. or to get you ready for your SCAMPI. </p>
