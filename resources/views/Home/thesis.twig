  <h2>More Detail on the PMIS Improvement Framework Dimensions</h2>
  <p>Step 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>An Enterprise Project Management Office (EPMO) must be in place and this must be running on a Project Management Information System (PMIS) in order to agree that step 1 is in place.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Enterprise Project Management Office (EPMO) operates with a similar imperative as an Accounting Department underpinned by a financial accounting system.&nbsp; What this means is that if 2 to 2000 projects are being run on the PMIS these projects are all unique and each run within their own project on the PMIS.&nbsp; The EPMO has final say on which projects are created within the PMIS and projects, programs and portfolio control as a view is available to the EPMO.&nbsp; The analogy is the shepherd herding a flock of sheep.&nbsp; Obviously, depending on how the EPMO and PMIS have been set up this can be broken down into sub groupings where projects in a province or state fall under the control of a sub PMO but nationally all projects must report into the EPMO.&nbsp; Ramifications for the rogue project are obvious.&nbsp; There cannot be a rogue project as all project activity falls under the auspices of the EPMO.</p>
  <p>Step 2:</p>
  <p>The EPMO PMIS has a central resource module wherein all project resources are loaded.&nbsp; This resource module as a database within the PMIS contains personal details of the project resources which can be beefed up to include latest skills.&nbsp; It is from this central resource pool that resources are allocated to project resource pools.</p>
  <p>Step 3:</p>
  <p>Each project that is created in the PMIS must have a Project Manager.&nbsp; In this regard the Project Manager can be seen as the driver of a car.&nbsp; While Agile, and Scrum in particular, see the Scrum Master as a servant leader who has limited management control, in order to achieve Capability Maturity Level 2 compliance, the Project Management role here is specifically appointed by the EPMO and is held accountable for project administration of the individual project on the PMIS.</p>
  <p>With regard to Step 2 above the Project Manager is responsible for allocating resources from his or her project resource pool, made available by the central EPMO resource module, to tasks on the project schedule.&nbsp; Figure 2 in Chapter 1 shows visually that a project task on the Developed Schedule is currently late and Joe Bloggs, the allocated resource, has missed his estimation of four hours to complete the work on Tuesday 12<sup>th</sup> of July when the task is looked at from Friday the 16<sup>th</sup> July 2016.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Step 4:</p>
  <p>The PMIS is a secure repository for all project artefacts.&nbsp; Obviously the Project Manager will have control over their project artefacts and it will be up to the Project Manager to ensure that these are uploaded and version controlled into his or her project in the PMIS.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However, the EPMO will also need to have control over project artefacts from a governance perspective.&nbsp; To this end a structure will probably need to be put into place where versions of a document are kept centrally allowing the Project Manager (and project resources, typically a Business Analyst) to check out a document, make changes and save these as a latest version.</p>
  <p>Some Project Management Information Systems also track code in a code repository like git.&nbsp; This means that code can be checked out by a programmer and then checked in later with updated code.</p>
  <p>If the PMBOK or Scrum Body of Knowledge are used as a reference then outputs of each process will clearly state what artefacts are required for that process.&nbsp; This means that as the project moves through its lifecycle key artefacts that will need to be stored and secured will be known and these can form the basis of an audit by the EPMO or other auditing body, if required.&nbsp; From a good governance perspective, it should be obvious that a project cannot be created by the EPMO unless the project has been officially authorised by its stakeholders (PMBOK processes 4.1 and 13.1) which typically would require an approved Project Charter document.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also for a traditional project a schedule cannot be put into execution if a project plan (PMBOK process #4.2) has not been approved and saved to the project repository.&nbsp; Typically this would be a scanned document with clearly legible signatures of the stakeholders.</p>
  <p>For an Agile project utilizing the Scrum Methodology, approved User Stories before the Sprint starts and a Sprint Report and Retrospective report could comprise core project artefacts that must be saved to the project repository on a regular (Sprint by Sprint)</p>
  <p>Step 5:</p>
  <p>Typically the Project Manager can configure the PMIS database to have Stage or Quality Gate selectors.&nbsp; While these can be many and varied, which should probably be kept to a minimum, an example of a simple Stage Gate may be Process Group selector for a Traditional Project.&nbsp; This means that only when all outputs for the Initiation Process Groups are in place can be project be moved into the Planning Process Group.&nbsp; The Stage or Quality Gate selector will be moved by the Project Manager indicating that the gate to the next Process Group is open, typically because a Charter document has been signed off.&nbsp; While it may appear that these fly in the face of agility this is actually not the case.&nbsp; Often projects run into trouble because they were not fully approved or initiated but are already burning budget in the Execution Process Group.&nbsp; The same can apply for the Planning Process Group for which numerous project
    artifacts are required including a sub plan for Scope, Cost, Time, Stakeholder Management etc., before a Project Plan (PMBOK process #4.2) or Project Schedule (PMBOK process #6.5) can be completed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Step 6:</p>
  <p>Any resource in the EPMO resource pool that is allocated to a Project resource pool by the EPMO / Project Manager will be configured with appropriate rights to work on the project schedule and other PMIS modules either via a local area network, wide area network or from anywhere accessible globally via the internet.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A real world example of this is that the researcher is currently working on this Dissertation, but is also logged onto his work virtual private network, via the internet, and has in the last 2 minutes updated information in an issue (user story) in a project where he is the Scrum Master on the Jira Project System and changed its status from Blocked to Do.&nbsp; He has also, in his role as Jira Administrator, added a user to another project on Jira.&nbsp; The researcher is working from home in Quellerina Johannesburg, but his office is in Sandton, while the Jira project server is in Randburg.&nbsp; It can also be noted that some of the resources who are working on his project are accessing it in real time from India.</p>
  <p>Step 7:</p>
  <p>The Project Schedule can be presented as a Gantt chart with Task slippage indicator capability.</p>
  <p>Figure 2 shows what this means.&nbsp; Task slippage is typically a setting that is put on or put off on a PMIS.&nbsp; Agile, Scrum boards typically do not have this functionality because the level of detail is not regarded as important in Agile.&nbsp; However, if a task is to contain sufficient information to facilitate monitoring and control, and if a baseline is also used, then slip lines are a natural extension of this showing that a tasks estimated due date for completion has been exceeded.</p>
  <p>The researcher is used to managing many project schedules on a PMIS and it is relatively easy, if the projects and PMIS are set up correctly, to open a project and scroll down it looking at the task slippage to get an idea of project status and health.</p>
  <p>Step 8:</p>
  <p>While slip lines are focused on tasks, schedule baselines are a copy of the original estimates to be used at a later point in time for comparison purposes.&nbsp; Variance tracking of actuals as at now on the PMIS at task level needs to be available against the saved original projects estimated schedule.&nbsp; The information as variances between actual and baseline can feed a number of indicators on the PMIS that show project health.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Visual representation for Step 7 and Step 8 above will facilitates using the project schedule as a playing field from a game theory perspective.</p>
  <p>Step 9:</p>
  <p>The EPMO and PMIS both work off a regular project reporting cycle.&nbsp; Typically this is tied to the actual versus plan versus budget.&nbsp; Project reporting cycles are must the same as financial reporting cycles.&nbsp; The importance of these is that they need to tie in with the project lifecycle.&nbsp; An example is a petrol gauge on a car.&nbsp; At the beginning of a trip the petrol tank is full.&nbsp; Into the journey the petrol gauge will drop depending on the amount of petrol remaining in the tank.&nbsp; The same applies to a project budget.&nbsp; The reporting cycle will tie in the start of the project with the start of the budget allocation to the project.&nbsp; Regular reporting cycles are then used to ensure that status is regularly monitored.&nbsp; To this end never looking at the gauge of a car while travelling is highly risky.&nbsp; If a reporting cycle is maintained then status reports must be produced regularly.&nbsp; These typically are available in real time on the PMIS but if produced to meet the requirements of the EPMO this can form the basis of an audit of project health imposed by the EPMO on the Project Manager and team.</p>
  <p>Top level EPMO summary reports should be available from the PMIS by program (groups of projects on the PMIS) or by a single project and with drill down capability to task level.</p>
  <p>Reports are typically made available to Project Boards, key sponsors (and identified stakeholders).&nbsp; As projects will become late &ldquo;a day at a time&rdquo; reports follow a weekly, week by week publication cycle.&nbsp; Reports also facilitate focus to work the Plan, Do, Check, Act cycle.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Step 10:</p>
  <p>Earned Value Management Analysis (and other) project status graphics, reports etc., are available on the PMIS.&nbsp; Figure 7 above shows the Earned Value Management graph.&nbsp; This is a standard graph used by Project Management Professionals.&nbsp; From a PMBOK perspective Earned Value Management includes all project formulas and especially the &ldquo;To Complete Performance Index&rdquo; as one number for project health throughout its lifecycle. Earned Value Management, built out of tasks and their status, is an essential PMIS reporting product facilitating the goal of using the project schedule as a playing field.</p>
  <p>Step 11:</p>
  <p>Issues are Risks happening.&nbsp; Serious Issues, which a project team are unable to solve need to be escalated up to the Project Board Executive or sponsor who are also members of the PMIS resource pool.&nbsp; Per Deming &ldquo;Such responsibility cannot be delegated.&rdquo; (Deming, 1986)</p>
  <p>Step 12:</p>
  <p>The PMIS Resource Pool is a focus of organizational attention towards people and their skills improvement for excellence.&nbsp; People excellence is dealt with in People Capability Maturity Mode (Annexure L).&nbsp; The goal in project management should be the creation of Empowered Teams which is a PCMM level 4 process.&nbsp; To get there requires expenditure on training for key roles in the team.</p>
  <p>The example of an American Football team comes to mind.&nbsp; Extensive training is made available so that team members can become the very best they can be.&nbsp; This could be teaching the team the detail behind the project methodology they have chosen.&nbsp; Or it could be teaching the latest coding technology to developers.&nbsp; Of how best to use a PMIS system etc.&nbsp; Per game theory, if a project can be regarded as a game, and best project team needs to be good enough to make it to the Super Bowl, then training of the right people is an essential part of excellence.&nbsp; The management of the resource pool towards best value software development should be self-evident.&nbsp; Obviously if staff are not a correct fit, or their behaviour is sub-optimal or tardy then as with American Football, they will not last long in a winning team.</p>
