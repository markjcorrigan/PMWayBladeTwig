  <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ITIL_4_Incident_Management">ITIL 4 Incident Management</span></h2>
  <p>The Incident Management process described here follows the specifications of ITIL V3, where <a class="mw-selflink selflink">Incident Management</a> is a process in the service lifecycle stage of Service Operation. </p>
  <p>ITIL V4 is no longer prescriptive about processes but shifts the focus on 34 'practices', giving organizations more freedom to define tailor-made processes. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>ITIL 4 therefore refers to Incident Management as a practice, describing Incident Management key activities, inputs, outputs and roles. Based on this guidance, organizations are advised to design a process for managing Incidents in line with their specific requirements.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Since the processes defined in ITIL V3 have not been invalidated with the introduction of ITIL V4, organizations can still use the ITIL V3 process of Incident Management as a template. </p>
  <p>What is more, in our YaSM Service Management Wiki we describe a <a class="external" href="https://yasm.com/wiki/en/index.php/Service_Management_Processes" title="Service management processes">leaner set of 19 service management processes</a> that are more in tune with ITIL 4 and its focus on simplicity and "just enough process". The YaSM service management model includes a <a class="external" href="https://yasm.com/wiki/en/index.php/LP4.6:_Resolve_incidents_and_service_requests" title="YaSM incident management process">process for managing incidents</a> that is a good starting point for organizations that wish to adopt ITIL 4. </p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Process_Description">Process Description</span></h2>
  <p>ITIL distinguishes between <a href="#Incident">Incidents</a> (service interruptions) and Service Requests  (customer or user requests that do not represent a service disruption, such as a password reset). Service interruptions are handled through Incident Management, and Service Requests through the ITIL V3 process of Request Fulfilment. </p>
  <p>The Incident Management process can be triggered in various ways: A user, customer or supplier may report an issue, technical staff may notice a (potential or actual) failure, or an Incident may be raised automatically by an event monitoring system. </p>
  <p>All <a href="#Incident-Categorization">Incidents should be logged as Incident Records</a>, where their status can be tracked, and a complete historical record maintained. Initial categorization and prioritization of Incidents is a critical step for determining how the Incident will be handled and how much time is available for its resolution (see&#160;checklist Incident Prioritization Guideline). </p>
  <p>If possible, Incidents should be matched to other Incidents, Problems and Known Errors. </p>
  <p>Organizations should use automated resolution tools and provide support portals with self-help information so users can resolve simple Incidents themselves. For other Incidents, <a href="#ITIL-Incident-Management-1st-Level">1st Level Support will try to diagnose and resolve the issue</a>, typically using information from a knowledge base or pre-defined Incident Models. </p>
  <p>If 1st Level Support is unable to resolve an Incident, it must be escalated to an appropriate specialist support group in 2nd Level Support ("functional escalation"). If required, <a href="#ITIL-Incident-Management-2nd-Level">2nd Level Support</a> may in turn involve external parties such as suppliers and vendors (in ITIL referred to as "3rd Level Support"). </p>
  <p>ITIL defines a special <a href="#Handling-of-Major-Incidents">process for dealing with Major Incidents</a> (emergencies that affect business-critical services and require immediate attention). Major Incidents typically require a temporary Major Incident Team to identify and implement the resolution. </p>
  <p>Once Incidents are resolved, 1st Level Support will formally close them. This includes verifying that the users are satisfied and ensuring that the Incident Record is fully documented (see&#160;<a href="#Incident-Closure">Incident Closure and Evaluation</a>). Any new Problems, Workarounds or Known Errors identified during Incident resolution should be forwarded to the Problem Management process. </p>
  <p>Incident Management interfaces with a number of other ITIL processes: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Event Management may raise an Incident Record if monitoring systems identify a condition that requires a response.</li>
    <li>Problem Management provides information to the Incident Management process, such as Workarounds and Known Errors. Problem Management uses data collected during Incident resolution for Problem identification.</li>
    <li>Change Management may be invoked from Incident Management if a Change is needed to resolve an Incident.</li>
    <li>Configuration Management provides data used to identify Incidents and link them to particular Configuration Items.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The overview diagram of '<a href="/images/itilsotwo.jpg" target="_blank" title="Incident-management-itil.jpg">ITIL Incident Management</a>' shows the key information flows and interfaces of the process. </p>

  <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ITIL_4_Incident_Management">ITIL 4 Incident Management</span></h2>
  <p>The Incident Management process described here follows the specifications of ITIL V3, where <a class="mw-selflink selflink">Incident Management</a> is a process in the service lifecycle stage of Service Operation. </p>
  <p>ITIL V4 is no longer prescriptive about processes but shifts the focus on 34 'practices', giving organizations more freedom to define tailor-made processes. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>ITIL 4 therefore refers to Incident Management as a practice, describing Incident Management key activities, inputs, outputs and roles. Based on this guidance, organizations are advised to design a process for managing Incidents in line with their specific requirements.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Since the processes defined in ITIL V3 have not been invalidated with the introduction of ITIL V4, organizations can still use the ITIL V3 process of Incident Management as a template. </p>
  <p>What is more, in our YaSM Service Management Wiki we describe a <a class="external" href="https://yasm.com/wiki/en/index.php/Service_Management_Processes" title="Service management processes">leaner set of 19 service management processes</a> that are more in tune with ITIL 4 and its focus on simplicity and "just enough process". The YaSM service management model includes a <a class="external" href="https://yasm.com/wiki/en/index.php/LP4.6:_Resolve_incidents_and_service_requests" title="YaSM incident management process">process for managing incidents</a> that is a good starting point for organizations that wish to adopt ITIL 4. </p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Process_Description">Process Description</span></h2>
  <p>ITIL distinguishes between <a href="#Incident">Incidents</a> (service interruptions) and Service Requests  (customer or user requests that do not represent a service disruption, such as a password reset). Service interruptions are handled through Incident Management, and Service Requests through the ITIL V3 process of Request Fulfilment. </p>
  <p>The Incident Management process can be triggered in various ways: A user, customer or supplier may report an issue, technical staff may notice a (potential or actual) failure, or an Incident may be raised automatically by an event monitoring system. </p>
  <p>All <a href="#Incident-Categorization">Incidents should be logged as Incident Records</a>, where their status can be tracked, and a complete historical record maintained. Initial categorization and prioritization of Incidents is a critical step for determining how the Incident will be handled and how much time is available for its resolution (see&#160;checklist Incident Prioritization Guideline). </p>
  <p>If possible, Incidents should be matched to other Incidents, Problems and Known Errors. </p>
  <p>Organizations should use automated resolution tools and provide support portals with self-help information so users can resolve simple Incidents themselves. For other Incidents, <a href="#ITIL-Incident-Management-1st-Level">1st Level Support will try to diagnose and resolve the issue</a>, typically using information from a knowledge base or pre-defined Incident Models. </p>
  <p>If 1st Level Support is unable to resolve an Incident, it must be escalated to an appropriate specialist support group in 2nd Level Support ("functional escalation"). If required, <a href="#ITIL-Incident-Management-2nd-Level">2nd Level Support</a> may in turn involve external parties such as suppliers and vendors (in ITIL referred to as "3rd Level Support"). </p>
  <p>ITIL defines a special <a href="#Handling-of-Major-Incidents">process for dealing with Major Incidents</a> (emergencies that affect business-critical services and require immediate attention). Major Incidents typically require a temporary Major Incident Team to identify and implement the resolution. </p>
  <p>Once Incidents are resolved, 1st Level Support will formally close them. This includes verifying that the users are satisfied and ensuring that the Incident Record is fully documented (see&#160;<a href="#Incident-Closure">Incident Closure and Evaluation</a>). Any new Problems, Workarounds or Known Errors identified during Incident resolution should be forwarded to the Problem Management process. </p>
  <p>Incident Management interfaces with a number of other ITIL processes: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Event Management may raise an Incident Record if monitoring systems identify a condition that requires a response.</li>
    <li>Problem Management provides information to the Incident Management process, such as Workarounds and Known Errors. Problem Management uses data collected during Incident resolution for Problem identification.</li>
    <li>Change Management may be invoked from Incident Management if a Change is needed to resolve an Incident.</li>
    <li>Configuration Management provides data used to identify Incidents and link them to particular Configuration Items.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The overview diagram of '<a href="/images/itilsotwo.jpg" target="_blank" title="Incident-management-itil.jpg">ITIL Incident Management</a>' shows the key information flows and interfaces of the process. </p>
