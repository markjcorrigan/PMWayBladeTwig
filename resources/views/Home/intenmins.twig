                <ol>
                  <li>Can you find and isolate the Requirements Management
                    process in the CM model above?<br>
                    It is found in Level 2 (Managed) which level focuses on
                    Project Management.<br>
                    Requirements Management (the REQM process) is the '<strong>WHAT</strong>' that projects must deliver. <br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Now find the Project Planning (PP) and Project Monitoring and Control (PMC) processes
                    in the CM model above?&nbsp; <br>
                    Understand that the CM model
                    presented above is highly simplified.&nbsp; <br>
                    Within the PMWay
                    web (and the CMMi texts from Carnegie Mellon University) far more detail
                    on this model is available.&nbsp; <br>
                    However, for our purposes, and
                    to illustrate the larger game that must be played for Quality
                    and Productivity improvements, PMWay believes that the above model is perfect!<br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Now can you find the PP and PMC processes on the <a href="" target="_blank">PMBOK 6 Dashboard</a>?&nbsp; <br>
                    (Hint:&nbsp; Because of the importance of PP and PMC, each has its own Process Group (with many
                    processes) found at the top of the Dashboard.)<br>
                    While PP is
                    summarized as a single entry in the CM Model above, its
                    detailed breakdown (process steps by Knowledge Area) is
                    conveniently made available to us via the PMBOK Dashboard.&nbsp; <br>
                    Do you know, due to the importance of the Planning Process Group,
                    24 out of the total of 49 PMBOK 6 processes are focused
                    specifically on planning processes!<br>
                    This means just under 50% of
                    all PMBOK 6 processes are planning processes!<br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Can you see that the PP and PMC processes bolster up (support /
                    enable) Project Execution (essentially the Direct and Manage Project
                    Work process #
                    4.3) on the PMBOK Dashboard?<br>
                    Now here is a really cool thing to
                    consider:&nbsp; From the PMBOK perspective, <strong>planning (the Planning
                    Process Group) is actually a GO / No Go check list</strong> that you
                    can use to show that you are ready to move
                    your preliminary 'Develop Schedule' planning process (# 6.5) into the Execution Process Group
                    as a '<strong>Developed Schedule</strong>' ready (when resources
                    are attached) for baseline.<br>
                    The Capability Maturity model
                    (which, per the model above, can install a variety of
                    improvement processes throughout
                    the organization) sees
                    this (PP) and (PMC) on either side of the Do The Work process (#
                    4.3) as a cyclical or repeatable improvement process called: <strong>Plan, Do, Check</strong> and then <strong>Act</strong>. <br>
                    Did you know that the essence of W. Edwards Deming's (the father of the Capability Maturity Model) Red Bead Experiment
                    and 14 Observations for Management <strong>are based on the Deming cycle or circle: Plan, Do, Check Act. </strong><br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Ultimately, as agile with
                    its limited planning and documentation is 'Risky Business';
                    and with these projects existing at the lower level of CM 2 (or at CM - 1 if
                    agile is badly executed), agile projects
                    MUST be managed with extra special care (tight Risk and Issue
                    management controls in place) for safety to ensure success.<br>
                    I.e. the section below (from the SCRUM Body
                    of Knowledge) elucidates:<br>

                      <p align="left"><strong>Step 3.</strong>&nbsp; Find the Requirements Management (REQM) Process Area within the Engineering Category. This is a Level 2 process. These, via ITIL

                        Per

                        <strong>Step 4.</strong>&nbsp; Find the Configuration Management (CM) Process Area in the Support Category. This is a

                essentially WHO, WHAT and by WHEN on a Gantt Chart in
                the PMIS.<br>
                (Collaboration is empowered when the Gantt
                Chart - project schedule - <br>
                is booked into (parked
                in) the PMIS)<br>

                <br>
                I.e. team member
                (developer) agrees to build software module product
                (from the Product backlog / SCRUM backlog) and books an
                estimated five hours of work on the PMIS.&nbsp; This TAsking
                is sent electronically to the SCRUM Master (PM) for approval and
                for a baseline.&nbsp;
                On completion the TAsk is updated as completed within
                five hours (on the task within the PMIS) and is then sent
                electronically to Quality Assurance by the developer.&nbsp;
                After TAsk is approved by Quality Assurance (and
                approval by the Product Owner) the TAsk is finally
                approved on the PMIS by SCRUM Master.&nbsp;&nbsp; I.e.
                this is the basis for collaboration on the PMIS.&nbsp;
                And guess what:&nbsp; resources can operate virtually
                within a TEAM (Together Everyone Achieves More) from
                anywhere on our planet and beyond, connected to the
                internet as they work the Developed Schedule (team's
                jointly owned and visible via the PMIS - playing field.<br>
                <br>
                Risk and Issue
                Management, essential for project success (and crucial for
                agile project health) is also undertaken by the team using
                PMIS collaboration.&nbsp; TEAM project progress (burn
                down chart etc.) is available on PMIS system either
                direct or summarized on overhead TV monitors.<br>

                Take another look at the Capability Maturity model
                above.<br>
                Can you now appreciate that the CM Level 2 processes around
                Project Monitoring and Control, Measurement and Analysis,
                Configuration Management, Product and Process Quality Assurance etc.,
                are all about producing and then improving production
                statistics!<br>
                <br>
                Production of these, are a breeze,
                from collaborative TAsking on the PMIS!<br>

        <p class="small text-center">Let PMWay state this very important point again:<br>
          As having a sound
          handle on your finances is dependent on good accounting
          software; <br>
          so to then is the effective and efficient
          handling of the processes PP and PMC in order to support hours of
          work (towards your project goal) as quantifiable (Start Change Stop) transactions
          called TAsking (Time Asking) on a Project Schedule. <br>
          This, like
          accounting software, is facilitated (empowered via team
          collaboration) through <br>
          the Project Management Information System
          (PMIS). <br>
          I.e. you can possibly
          achieve CM level 2 success without a PMIS, but, due to TAsk
          management complexity it will
          be very difficult!<br>
          Anything less than a PMIS for complex
          projects, PMWay suggests, is just playing very expensive and risky
          games!<br>
          And if you think that post it notes on
          a white board (operating at CM L1) will do all this for you; then good luck! <br>
          You are going to need it!</p>

      <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
      <h5>
      Remember that projects must be carefully considered <br>
      before they
      change the company culture / system configuration baseline.<br/>
      I.e. the starting point for any change <strong>IS NOT TO CHANGE</strong> <br>
      unless there is
      quantifiable business benefit in doing so.<br>
      <br>
      If
      there is agreement to change then use the PMBOK dashboard <br>
      focusing on
      the Developed Schedule (6.5) on the
      Project Server <br/>
      for TAsking (Time Asking) and scheduling success,<br/>
      <strong>to improve project productivity statistics and team 'touchdown'
      capability</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      PMWay recommends PRINCE2
      Agile for the recipe, <br>
      using PMBOK for the ingredients.<br>
      <br>
      And while the Project Server ensures TAsking (Time Asking), <br>
      and CMMi is
      the improvement path you must travel, <br>
      DevOps, ITIL and Cobit align your efforts
      from a DevOps TEAM, <br>

            CML

                  Risk and Issue
                  Management, essential for project success (crucial for

                  PMIS collaboration.<br>
                  I.e. as Issues are Risks
                  happening, as soon as an Issue is raised a TAsk must be
                  created to resolve it.<br>
                  If the team is unable to
                  resolve a particular Issue then this, if serious, will
                  need to be escalated
                  immediately to the PRINCE2 Agile Board.&nbsp; As this is
                  done by the system it will be a seamless and system
                  based escalation visible to all on the
                  project working on (logged onto) the PMIS.<br>
                  <br>
                  Obviously the best and most qualified people (regardless
                  of colour, creed, race, sexual orientation etc.) must be
                  selected for these projects.<br>
                  (The practice of BBBEE
                  and cadre deployment, which is economic idiocy in the form of reverse Apartheid
