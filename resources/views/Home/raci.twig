  <h3>RACI Matrix</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>A project management tool often used to pin down
    communication requirements is called the RACI matrix.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> <img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/images/racithree.jpg" ></p>
  <p>This matrix puts the audience along one axis and then ties this
    up with the types of communication they need to receive along
    the other axis by:</p>
  <h4><span id="Key_responsibility_roles"
                      class="mw-headline">Key responsibility roles</span></h4>
  <dl>
    <dt class="auto-style1">Responsible</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Those who do the work to achieve the task. There is
        typically one role with a participation type of <i> responsible</i>, although others can be delegated to assist
        in the work required (see also <i>RASCI</i> below for
        separately identifying those who participate in a supporting
        role).</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt><span class="auto-style2"><em>Accountable (also approver or final
      approving authority</em></span>)</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The one ultimately answerable for the correct and
        thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and the one
        from whom <i>responsible</i> is delegated the work. In other words, an <i> accountable</i> must sign off (approve) on work that <i> responsible</i> provides. There <b>must</b> be only one <i>accountable</i> specified for each task or deliverable.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt><span class="auto-style2"><em>Consulted (sometimes
      counsel</em></span>)</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Those whose opinions are sought, typically subject
        matter experts; and with whom there is two-way
        communication.&nbsp; <br />
        Note:&nbsp; The image above sees consulted as a gate.&nbsp;
        I.e. Must be consulted before a decision can be taken.&nbsp;
        The suitable response will need to be defined within the
        project context.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt class="auto-style2"><em>Informed</em></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Those who are kept up-to-date on progress, often only on
        completion of the task or deliverable; and with whom there
        is just one-way communication.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>Very often the role that is <i>accountable</i> for a task or deliverable may also be <i>responsible</i> for completing it (indicated on the matrix by
    the task or deliverable having a role <i>accountable</i> for it, but no role <i>responsible</i> for its completion, I.e. it is implied).
    Outside of this exception, it is generally recommended that each
    role in the project or process for each task receive, at most,
    just one of the participation types. Where more than one
    participation type is shown, this generally implies that
    participation has not yet been fully resolved, which can impede
    the value of this technique in clarifying the participation of
    each role on each task.</p>

        remains the same but this alternative avoids potential
        confusion of the terms <i>accountable</i> and <i>responsible</i>, which may be understood by management

  <dl>
    <dd>
      <p>There is an alternative <i>coding</i>, less widely
        published but used by some practitioners and process mapping
        software, which modifies the application of the <i>R</i> and <i> A</i> codes of the original scheme. The overall methodology
        remains the same but this alternative avoids potential
        confusion of the terms <i>accountable</i> and <i>responsible</i>, which may be understood by management
        professionals but not always so clearly differentiated by
        others:</p>
