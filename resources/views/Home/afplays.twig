  <p>With the glorious return of the NFL and pro football into our lives,
    we all better study up on our terminology, such as common offensive
    strategies used by NFL teams. New football fans have their work cut
    out for them, but even longtime diehards can use some sharpening up
    with the NFL back in town. In this piece I&#39;ll cover some basic and
    common offensive strategies used in the NFL. Some might be obvious,
    others you might recognize but still be a bit confused about what it
    literally means. If you need to catch up more, be sure to check out

    Defense and 4-3 Defense</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>and
    more.<br />
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>Empty Backfield</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    The empty backfield is an offensive formation used by NFL teams when
    they want to spread the defense thin and pass the ball. There are no
    running backs or extra men in the backfield behind the quarterback.
    There can be up to 5 wide receivers in the empty backfield
    formation. With so many men spread around the field, the defense is
    forced to spread out as well, which either leaves playmakers in
    one-on-one coverage they can exploit or in a zone coverage where
    they might not be picked up at all.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>The Shotgun</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    Shotgun is an offensive formation that&#39;s actually more common in<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>college
    football than in the NFL, however has been used a great deal in
    recent years by many teams, including the New England Patriots. In
    shotgun, the quarterback is not directly behind the center but
    rather is about 5 yards behind him. Typically, a running back will
    be at approximately the same depth as the quarterback behind the
    line of scrimmage. The shotgun formation has several advantages,
    including giving the quarterback a better view of the defense and
    allowing him more time and space to escape from pressure. A downside
    to the shotgun formation is that it can be difficult to effectively
    run the ball.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>The Hail Mary</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    The Hail Mary is an offensive play used when a team needs a prayer.
    Typically only done at the end of a game or the end of a half with
    no other options, the Hail Mary usually starts out of shotgun and
    sends multiple receivers all the way down the length of the field,
    to the farthest distance the quarterback can throw. Commonly there
    will be three or four receivers bunched up on one side and one
    receiver on the opposite side, freeing him up to be left in single
    coverage. If thrown to the busy side, the offense basically hopes
    for some tips and reflections that allow a receiver to luckily
    escape with the ball. The offense also hopes for a defensive pass
    interference penalty that moves them up the field, for even with no
    time on the clock, the NFL allows one further play following a
    defensive penalty, giving the offense a scoring chance. Defensive
    players are taught to keep their hands off the players and to not
    attempt to intercept the ball, but just knock the ball to the
    ground. The term was first coined not in the NFL but in the college
    football game, following Doug Flutie&#39;s miracle play while at Boston
    College in 1984.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>The Draw Play</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    The draw play is the rare type of running play that is most commonly
    used out of the shotgun formation. The offense initially shows that
    they are passing the ball, by not handing the ball off right away,
    running pass routes and pass blocking. After this setup, the ball is
    then handed off to a running back that now hopefully has more room
    to run against a defense that reacted to a pass play. The offense
    hopes it has drawn the defense down the field to open up the
    designed run.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>Quarterback Draw</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    A quarterback draw is a variation of the draw play where the
    quarterback will run the ball himself. This is used in short yardage
    situations and goal line situations and is used more often by NFL
    teams who possess a duel threat quarterback, such as Vince Young.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>Play</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><b>Action
    Pass</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>- The play
    action pass is the offensive strategy opposite of the draw play. The
    draw play hopes to fool the defense into reacting to a pass, opening
    up space to run. The play action pass hopes to lure the defense into
    charging up to stop the run, leaving room downfield for open passing
    lanes. At the snap, the quarterback drops back and tries to sell a
    handoff to a running back, who then begins running as he would
    normally with the ball. If successful, a few extra yards of space
    will open in the middle of the field where the linebackers should
    have been, leaving room for a successful passing opportunity. The
    master of the play action pass, which largely depends on getting the
    defense to believe in what you&#39;re doing, has been<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Peyton
    Manning<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>of the
    Indianapolis Colts.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>Screen Pass</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    The concept of a screen pass can be thought of as taking cues from
    both the draw play and the play action pass. Like the draw play, you
    want the defense to be expecting a down the field passing situation.
    At the same time though, like the play action pass, you want the
    defense to charge in, leaving space to pass the ball. In essence,
    the screen pass is a short pass, thrown just to about the line of
    scrimmage, to a speedy and maneuverable player. The offensive line,
    instead of staying in pass protection, releases to the side of the
    field the pass will be thrown to. This gives a full line of blockers
    in front of the receiver, or a screen, promising a potentially huge
    play if done properly. Many things can go wrong, including penalties
    for the offensive line being too far downfield too quickly. The
    riskiest aspect of the screen pass however is that the offensive
    line leaves the quarterback unprotected, meaning he has to be able
    to get rid of the ball before the defense collapses on him
    completely. Many NFL teams use the screen pass to various degrees of
    the success, with the best teams having refined the play to have
    perfect timing and blocking. The skillset and vision of Ladainian
    Tomlinson<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>makes him
    the perfect candidate to excel and explode in a screen pass, and the San
    Diego Chargers<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>are
    more than willing to oblige, deploying him often in such situations.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>The Dump Off</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    A dump off is an offensive strategy used at every level of football,
    including the NFL. The dump off is a quarterback&#39;s safety valve on a
    passing play. Specifically, a running back will stay towards one
    side of the field, either at or behind the line of scrimmage. The
    quarterback may have checked all of his other receivers and found
    they were covered, or he may be under heavy pressure from the
    defense, forcing him to get rid of the ball sooner than he wanted.
    Either way, he dumps the ball off to his waiting man as a means of
    cutting his losses and trying to make something positive out of the
    play. If forgotten about and left uncovered, the player may have a
    huge amount of open space ahead of him to advance the ball. This
    play is alternatively called a<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><b>check
    down</b>.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>North-South</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    The term North-South is used in NFL football to describe a style of
    running. North-South means that a running play is designed to go
    straight down the field, as opposed to going to either side of the
    field. It also means the play won&#39;t have any cutbacks or changes of
    direction. The play heads straight down the field vertically, and so
    it is referred to as North-South. Teams in the NFL like the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a class="link interlink" href="http://voices.yahoo.com/topic/14987/denver_broncos.php" rel="&amp;content_type=topic&amp;content_type_id=14987" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);" title="Denver Broncos">Denver
    Broncos</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>commonly
    deploy only North-South running plays to great success, relying on
    the offensive line to make one hole and the running back to surge
    forward through it quickly.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>Between the
    Tackles</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>- A
    North-South running play will also be a running play between the
    tackles. This literally means the play takes place in the space on
    the field between the left tackle and right tackle of the offensive
    line. Between the tackles running can be more difficult, with more
    defenders (and bigger ones) crowded between the lines. So this type
    of offensive play is used with larger, sturdier running backs that
    can barrel through the mess of players. Jerome Bettis was a
    prototypical between the tackles runner, while nobody would mistake
    Reggie Bush for being one.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>Man in Motion</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    A man in motion describes the offensive strategy used whereby before
    the snap of the ball, a player changes his position on the field.
    This is done for several reasons, including confusing the defense,
    forcing the defense to reveal its coverage and changing blocking and
    protection schemes. A wide receiver for example may be signaled by
    his quarterback, typically with a lift of his leg during the snap
    count, to run to the other side of the field. If a defensive man
    follows him, the defense has shown itself to be in man-to-man
    coverage. If nobody follows him, the defense is in zone.
    Alternatively, a defense may be showing a heavy blitz to one side of
    the formation. The quarterback might then send a tight end or
    running back over from the opposite side to aid in blocking. Other
    uses for the man in motion include giving a wide receiver a head of
    steam prior to the snap, allowing him to quickly advance with the
    ball or get downfield into an opening.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>The End Around</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    The end around is a type of offensive play based upon the speed and
    quickness of a wide receiver. Often times, an NFL team will use a
    special teams or defensive player with great speed in this
    situation. In an end around, a wide receiver runs behind the line of
    scrimmage to take a handoff from the quarterback, proceeding across
    to the opposite side of the field. By the time he hits the line of
    scrimmage he should hopefully be at full speed and be a bit ahead of
    the defense. An end around play often starts with a man in motion.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>The Reverse</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    A reverse is similar to an end around, however in a reverse play,
    the quarterback first hands the ball off to a running back as
    normal. The running back then hands off to the wide receiver going
    in the opposite direction, hence reversing the momentum of the play
    and hoping to catch the defense overcommitted to the other side of
    the field.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>The Double Reverse</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    Offensive strategy in the NFL is a constant game of trying to
    outthink the opposition. In doing so, more and more teams turn to
    the double reverse for an occasional trick play and attempt to catch
    the defense unprepared. The play begins with a reverse, and then has
    the addition of a second wide receiver running the opposite
    direction as the first. The first wide receiver hands off to the
    second, again reversing the direction of the play, this time back to
    the original side of the field. However, these plays have become
    more predictable and easy to sniff out in the NFL and many result in
    losses or small gains from well schooled defenses.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>The Rollout</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    The rollout is an offensive play used where the quarterback will
    leave the pocket of his pass protection and head towards a side of
    the field rather than dropping back and waiting. This is done most
    often in the NFL with quarterbacks who are fast and athletic, such
    as Steve Young and John Elway in their primes. While running to one
    side of the field, the pass routes will be designed to the same side
    of the field, so the quarterback does not have to throw across his
    body and across the length of the field. If nobody is open, the
    quarterback can turn the rollout into a running play and head
    downfield himself for a gain. The goal is to make the defense choose
    between covering the receivers or stopping the quarterback&#39;s run. A
    confused or indecisive defender will get stuck in no man&#39;s land,
    neither covering the receiver nor stopping the run, leaving room for
    a big play.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>The Bootleg</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    The bootleg is often confused with the rollout and with good reason,
    there is really only one difference between the two offensive
    strategies. A bootleg first has the quarterback fake a handoff to a
    running back going in the opposite direction. He then heads to the
    side of the field and again can choose between run and pass, forcing
    the defense to make a decision about how to cover the play.</p>

    straight down the field, as opposed to going to either side of the
    field. It also means the play won&#39;t have any cutbacks or changes of
    direction. The play heads straight down the field vertically, and so
    it is referred to as North-South.

    Broncos</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>commonly
    deploy only North-South running plays to great success, relying on
    the offensive line to make one hole and the running back to surge
    forward through it quickly.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>Between the
    Tackles</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>- A
    North-South running play will also be a running play between the
    tackles. This literally means the play takes place in the space on
    the field between the left tackle and right tackle of the offensive
    line. Between the tackles running can be more difficult, with more
    defenders (and bigger ones) crowded between the lines. So this type
    of offensive play is used with larger, sturdier running backs that
    can barrel through the mess of players. Jerome Bettis was a
    prototypical between the tackles runner, while nobody would mistake
    Reggie Bush for being one.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>Man in Motion</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    A man in motion describes the offensive strategy used whereby before
    the snap of the ball, a player changes his position on the field.
    This is done for several reasons, including confusing the defense,
    forcing the defense to reveal its coverage and changing blocking and
    protection schemes. A wide receiver for example may be signaled by
    his quarterback, typically with a lift of his leg during the snap
    count, to run to the other side of the field. If a defensive man
    follows him, the defense has shown itself to be in man-to-man
    coverage. If nobody follows him, the defense is in zone.
    Alternatively, a defense may be showing a heavy blitz to one side of
    the formation. The quarterback might then send a tight end or
    running back over from the opposite side to aid in blocking. Other
    uses for the man in motion include giving a wide receiver a head of
    steam prior to the snap, allowing him to quickly advance with the
    ball or get downfield into an opening.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>The End Around</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    The end around is a type of offensive play based upon the speed and
    quickness of a wide receiver. Often times, an NFL team will use a
    special teams or defensive player with great speed in this
    situation. In an end around, a wide receiver runs behind the line of
    scrimmage to take a handoff from the quarterback, proceeding across
    to the opposite side of the field. By the time he hits the line of
    scrimmage he should hopefully be at full speed and be a bit ahead of
    the defense. An end around play often starts with a man in motion.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>The Reverse</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    A reverse is similar to an end around, however in a reverse play,
    the quarterback first hands the ball off to a running back as
    normal. The running back then hands off to the wide receiver going
    in the opposite direction, hence reversing the momentum of the play
    and hoping to catch the defense overcommitted to the other side of
    the field.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>The Double Reverse</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    Offensive strategy in the NFL is a constant game of trying to
    outthink the opposition. In doing so, more and more teams turn to
    the double reverse for an occasional trick play and attempt to catch
    the defense unprepared. The play begins with a reverse, and then has
    the addition of a second wide receiver running the opposite
    direction as the first. The first wide receiver hands off to the
    second, again reversing the direction of the play, this time back to
    the original side of the field. However, these plays have become
    more predictable and easy to sniff out in the NFL and many result in
    losses or small gains from well schooled defenses.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>The Rollout</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    The rollout is an offensive play used where the quarterback will
    leave the pocket of his pass protection and head towards a side of
    the field rather than dropping back and waiting. This is done most
    often in the NFL with quarterbacks who are fast and athletic, such
    as Steve Young and John Elway in their primes. While running to one
    side of the field, the pass routes will be designed to the same side
    of the field, so the quarterback does not have to throw across his
    body and across the length of the field. If nobody is open, the
    quarterback can turn the rollout into a running play and head
    downfield himself for a gain. The goal is to make the defense choose
    between covering the receivers or stopping the quarterback&#39;s run. A
    confused or indecisive defender will get stuck in no man&#39;s land,
    neither covering the receiver nor stopping the run, leaving room for
    a big play.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px;"><b>The Bootleg</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>-
    The bootleg is often confused with the rollout and with good reason,
    there is really only one difference between the two offensive
    strategies. A bootleg first has the quarterback fake a handoff to a
    running back going in the opposite direction. He then heads to the
    side of the field and again can choose between run and pass, forcing
    the defense to make a decision about how to cover the play.</p>
