<p align="left"><font color="black"><b>Some ministers a bit too happy to wield total control without the nuisance of a bill of rights
Sunday Times: 7 Jun 2020 (By BARNEY MTHOMBOTHI)</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="black">Gwede Mantashe, the national chair of the ANC who moonlights as President Cyril Ramaphosa's erratic minerals and energy minister, said something the other day that, thanks to the all-consuming power of the pandemic, passed almost unnoticed. "The country will never be the same again," he tweeted. "The economy will never be the same again. Mining in SA will never be the same again. The current lockdown regulations will be applicable far beyond the lockdown period."

There can be no quarrel with the first part. The country will indeed be different. It will be poorer. The economy will tank even further. Millions will lose their jobs, adding to an unemployment rate already among the highest in the world. Hunger and suffering will skyrocket. And, most distressingly, thousands of our people will perish from this disease. Mantashe is right. What could happen to this country and its people in the coming weeks and months is truly terrifying. The pandemic is obviously to blame, but the pernicious effect of the organisation and government Mantashe is part of - the corruption, incompetence and sheer ignorance - will exacerbate Covid-19's devastating harvest.

It is, however, Mantashe's last sentence that is revealing. He states it as fact that the regulations will outlive the lockdown period or the pandemic.<br>
<br>

Experts have described some of the lockdown regulations as dubious, if not wholly unconstitutional. Almost as a warning shot, the high court in Pretoria this week declared level 3 and 4 lockdown rules unconstitutional and invalid. Judge Norman Davis gave co-operative governance & traditional affairs minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma 14 days to fix them. The government says it will appeal.

Mantashe's comments only confirm a suspicion that the lockdown, apart from slowing down the pandemic, allows the government to operate outside the purview of the constitution - and that it regards the constitution as an encumbrance and a hindrance.

One sometimes gets the impression that the government would be happy if some of the provisions of the constitution were completely done away with. Mantashe's remarks seem to reinforce that view. The constitution is seen not as a cornerstone of our democracy but as an impediment, a hurdle. Rather than championing the constitution and shoring up citizens' support for and belief in it, the government seeks in every way to undermine it.

Witness the almost obscene excitement with which some ministers welcomed the lockdown and the chance to make up their own rules. The regulations have given them an opportunity to exercise real power, and that seems to have taken precedence over their actual purpose - to slow down the transmission of the virus.

One of Mantashe's SACP colleagues, the tactless Solly Mapaila, told this newspaper last week that Covid-19 has given the state an opportunity to "discipline capital and the private sector", which he said were at their "weakest". People are dying and all these worthies think about is how they can acquire more power.

It's quite disturbing to hear people in the ANC referring to business, a significant sector of society, as an enemy. But then, given the way the likes of Bheki Cele address the public, one would swear that ordinary people, too, are regarded as enemies.<br>
<br>



But business, not the government, creates jobs. Without business there's no economy and therefore no jobs, no workers and therefore no unions. And ultimately people will starve. That surely is the lesson of the past few months, if any tutorial were needed. A few weeks' lockdown of the economy has seen thousands of people queuing and begging for food. With the best will in the world, the government can never satisfy such demand. Only a thriving economy can.

The SACP, with its discredited policies, behaves as though the Berlin Wall is still intact. It hasn't learnt the lessons of that epoch. If it had, it would, like its counterparts in the Soviet bloc, have disbanded long ago. It is afraid to submit itself to the will of the people through elections because it knows it will be rejected decisively and that would be curtains for it. It won't take that risk.

So the likes of Mantashe, Blade Nzimande and Thulas Nxesi sit in government wearing two hats. When Ebrahim Patel, as trade, industry and competition minister, whose portfolio is at the heart of driving economic activity, looks at a range of policy options, which ideological inclination takes precedence? Does he seek to grow the economy or does he see things through his class-war prism?

It would be fine if he or his colleagues were to apply their class-war mentality after winning an election. That, after all, is what democracy is all about. But the communists are wielding power without a mandate, piggybacking on the governing party.

The SACP has never been happy with the constitutional settlement, which it regards as a neoliberal arrangement. It wants a revolution. Mantashe probably sees the lockdown regulations as providing such an opportunity.  The ANC should do away with this entryism. In fact the whole tripartite alliance is an anachronism. It should be discarded. Let everyone who desires the exercise of power stand for election on his own merits, not hide behind someone else's skirts.

The cacophony of discordant voices at the top has led to policy confusion and dissonance, which the country can ill afford, especially in the face of such a dreadful pandemic.</font></p>

The amount of schools, hospitals and pints we could have had for this money is
enough to turn the stomach. Here's the real cost of state capture.  <br><br>Article By

<p align="left"><font color="black">Cyril Ramaphosa is currently on a visit to the United Kingdom, taking a good
look at the place before Brexit.&nbsp; President may have thought he could slip one under the rug regarding the cost of
state capture.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="black">That has not proven to be the case. Although Ramaphosa told foreign
investment interests that Mzansi has now stemmed the bleeding from state
capture, he conceded that a whopping R500 billion ($34 billion) may have been
stolen during jacob zuma's nine-year tenure. That's not bleeding. That's the
elevator doors opening up in The Shining.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="black">How much has state capture cost South Africa? That's a heck of a lot of
money. It's just under half of what zuma wanted to give the Russians in exchange
for an ill-conceived nuclear power deal. So perhaps we should be thankful?
Well, that's not going to be easy. Not when you consider we could have spent
that humongous wad of cash on the following:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="black">Over 5 000 new state-of-the-art schools. Around 10 billion pints of imported,
premium beer; that's around 166 drinks each for every man, woman and child in
South Africa. Almost 20 000 health clinics, fully-staffed and equipped with
modern technology. Just under five billion kilograms of cheddar cheese. Around
170 000 new Volkswagen Golf 1.4 litre engine (brand new). 400 million pairs of
new Nike trainers. Thanks state capture 33 billion litres of petrol. 62.5
million return flights from Johannesburg to Dubai, so we could *all* replicate
the Guptas' escape from South Africa. Speaking of Dubai; You could build 12 more
exact replicas of the tallest building in the world, The Burj Khalifa. You could
wipe out Eskom's entire debt (R420 billion) and use the remaining cost of R80
billion to buy the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, belonging to Queen
Elizabeth and her family. (All stats were provided by linked sources)<br>

<h5 align="left">Product Owners Are the New Release Managers</h5>
<p>The release management team has been made partially redundant by machines. It is not
absolute because of two reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need an owner for the entire release management process that
cuts across both development and operations.</li>
<li>Cognitive abilities are very much in demand to ensure that the
release management process succeeds and aligns with the objectives
set forth.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">The person who manages the entire release from end to end is the release manager
and is still necessary. However, the release management role went from being a full-time
position to a part-time one (statistically speaking), mainly because of the diminished
work (thanks to automation). Capable release managers are

<ol>
<li>Well aware of the customer landscape, the requirements, and to
an extent the business priorities</li>
<li>Fully involved in the development and deployment processes</li>
<li>Understands operations and their acceptance criteria</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">The person who could do all this in the past was the product owner (PO), and thus
that person is a favorite choice for a part-time release manager. POs are an adequate
choice mainly because of their closeness to the business and to the development
and operations teams. The person was like a bridge between the two entities and was
expected to keep the boat going in the most turbulent conditions.</p><br>
<p align="left">Thanks Abhinav (page 294)<br>

Executive to produce products in PRINCE2 Agile</a></p>

<h5 align="left">Product Owners Are the New Release Managers</h5>
<p>The release management team has been made partially redundant by machines. It is not
absolute because of two reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need an owner for the entire release management process that
cuts across both development and operations.</li>
<li>Cognitive abilities are very much in demand to ensure that the
release management process succeeds and aligns with the objectives
set forth.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">The person who manages the entire release from end to end is the release manager
and is still necessary. However, the release management role went from being a full-time
position to a part-time one (statistically speaking), mainly because of the diminished
work (thanks to automation). Capable release managers are

<ol>
<li>Well aware of the customer landscape, the requirements, and to
an extent the business priorities</li>
<li>Fully involved in the development and deployment processes</li>
<li>Understands operations and their acceptance criteria</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">The person who could do all this in the past was the product owner (PO), and thus
that person is a favorite choice for a part-time release manager. POs are an adequate
choice mainly because of their closeness to the business and to the development
and operations teams. The person was like a bridge between the two entities and was
expected to keep the boat going in the most turbulent conditions.</p>

                                    <p align="left">PDCA (plan do check act or plan do check adjust) is an iterative four-step management method used in business for the control and continuous improvement of processes and products. It is also known as the Deming circle/cycle/wheel, Shewhart cycle, control circle/cycle, or
									plan do study act (PDSA). Another version of this PDCA cycle is OPDCA. The added &quot;O&quot; stands for observation or as some versions say &quot;Grasp the current condition.&quot; This emphasis on observation and current condition has currency with Lean manufacturing/Toyota Production System literature.</p>

By establishing output expectations, the completeness and accuracy of the spec is also a part of the targeted improvement. When possible start on a small scale to test possible effects.</p>

                                                    <p align="left">Study the actual results (measured and collected in "DO" above) and compare against the expected results (targets or goals from the "PLAN") to ascertain any differences. Look for deviation in implementation from the plan and also look for the appropriateness and completeness of the plan to enable the execution, i.e., "Do". Charting data can make this much easier to see trends over several PDCA cycles and in order to convert the collected data into information. Information is what you need for the next step "ACT".
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p align="left">Request corrective actions on significant differences between actual and planned results. Analyze the differences to determine their root causes. Determine where to apply changes that will include improvement of the process or product. When a pass through these four steps does not result in the need to improve, the scope to which PDCA is applied may be refined to plan and improve with more detail in the next iteration of the cycle, or attention needs to be placed in a different stage of the process.</p>
                                                        <p align="left">Note: Some modern trainers now also refer to the "A" as "Adjust". This helps trainees to understand that the 4th step is more about adjusting/correcting the difference between the current state and the planned state instead of thinking that the "A" is all about action and implementation (which actually happens in the second ("D") stage).</p>

                                                        We all know that Plan-Do-Check-Act is the heart of Continuous Improvement, so why do so many business leaders fall down when it comes to Check-Act? And what should they do about it? </p>
                                                    <p align="left">Directors and Senior Managers provided that they aren't completely stuck in fire-fighting mode are usually quite happy with the Plan part.
                                                        <br> They've been trained to set SMART objectives, they appraise their direct reports regularly, and they regularly provide effective feedback. They understand effective Project Management and perhaps apply Hoshin Planning/Policy Deployment. Having worked out the Plan, they often develop their people by delegating the Doing. They know that for people to learn, grow and develop they need to be challenged and supported. So they expect the best but they also provide plenty of support. In other words they coach: they work with their people, they don't do it to them or do it for them. </p>
                                                    <p align="left"><strong>Sounds great, doesn't it?</strong> </p>
                                                    <p align="left">But experienced leaders know the reality coaching can be time-consuming, frustrating, and damned hard work! And often there just don't seem to be enough hours in the day. </p>
                                                    <p align="left">That's one reason why many managers instead of delegating, coaching and empowering often let people just get on with it. And most operations folk are very good at getting on with it it's what they like, it's what they're good at, and traditionally it's often what they're rewarded for. </p>
                                                    <p align="left">The problem is that most people are good at doing what they've always done, in the way that they've always done it. So they produce the same results that they've always produced not always consistently, and not always Right First Time. At an
													organizational level, that leads to inertia and complacency and that in turn hampers learning which ultimately leads to extinction. </p>
                                                    <p align="left"><strong>Maybe it's human
                              nature: we all want to improve we just don't want to change. Yet in our hearts we know
                              that if we really want to improve then we have to change what we
                              do or how we do it.</strong></p>
                                                    <p align="left"> We have to stand back and review what we do, and what we get, and then we need to take action as appropriate. As leaders we have to make sure that reviews are properly conducted, that follow-up's actually happen and that actions are taken. In other words, we need to spend time on Check and Act. So how do we actually do this in practice? </p>
                                                    <p align="left">
                                                        <strong>The answer as with most improvement activities is: (1) Start Simple; and (2) Make it

                                                    <p align="left">This is an ideal opportunity to lead by example show colleagues how quick and easy a review can be, and how useful it is. Once people begin to get the review habit, you can move on to
													formalize it, by including review and action steps in your key processes. To start with, focus on the areas of the business where this will have the biggest impact or where you most need to improve. Maybe it's after completion of each major project, job or contract. Get the team together formally with your supplier(s) and customer(s), if at all possible and ask honestly what went well, what didn't go to plan, and what you can learn from this. </p>
                                                    <p align="left">How you handle these sessions goes to the heart of the

                                                    <p align="left">If you haven't sufficiently closed the gap between as is and should be then you need to go through the PDCA cycle again.</p>
                                                    <p align="left">And remember the Act part isn't done until you've taken full advantage of any read-across opportunities, you've removed those initial quick fixes and you've embedded your new One Best Way until next time!

                                                    <p align="left">PDCA was made popular by Dr W. Edwards Deming, who is considered by many to be the father of modern quality control; however, he always referred to it as the "Shewhart cycle". Later in Deming's career, he modified PDCA to "Plan, Do, Study, Act" (PDSA) because he felt that "check" emphasized inspection over analysis.</p>

                                                    <p align="left">The concept of PDCA is based on the scientific method, as developed from the work of Francis Bacon (Novum Organum, 1620). The scientific method can be written as "hypothesis&quot;
													&quot;experiment&quot; &quot;evaluation" or plan, do and check. Shewhart described manufacture under "control
													”under statistical control &quot;
													as a three-step process of specification, production, and inspection. He also specifically related this to the scientific method of hypothesis, experiment, and evaluation. Shewhart says that the statistician "must help to change the demand [for goods] by showing how to close up the tolerance range and to improve the quality of goods." Clearly, Shewhart intended the analyst to take action based on the conclusions of the evaluation. According to Deming, during his lectures in Japan in the early 1950s, the Japanese participants shortened the steps to the now traditional plan, do, check, act. Deming preferred plan, do, study, act because "study" has connotations in English closer to Shewhart's intent than "check".</p>

                                                    <p align="left">A fundamental principle of the scientific method and PDCA is
													iteration &quot;once a hypothesis is confirmed (or negated), executing the cycle again will extend the knowledge further. Repeating the PDCA cycle can bring us closer to the goal, usually a perfect operation and output.</p>

                                                    <p align="left">Another fundamental function of PDCA is the "hygienic" separation of each phase, for if not properly separated measurements of effects due to various simultaneous actions (causes) risk becoming confounded.</p>

                                                    <p align="left">PDCA (and other forms of scientific problem solving) is also known as a system for developing critical thinking. At Toyota this is also known as "Building people before building cars." Toyota and other Lean companies propose that an engaged, problem-solving workforce using PDCA is better able to innovate and stay ahead of the competition through rigorous problem solving and the subsequent innovations. This also creates a culture of problem solvers using PDCA and creating a culture of critical thinkers.</p>

                                                    <p align="left">In Six Sigma programs, the PDCA cycle is called "define, measure, analyze, improve, control" (DMAIC). The iterative nature of the cycle must be explicitly added to the DMAIC procedure.</p>

                                                    <p align="left">Deming continually emphasized iterating towards an improved system, hence PDCA should be repeatedly implemented in spirals of increasing knowledge of the system that converge on the ultimate goal, each cycle closer than the previous. One can envision an open coil spring, with each loop being one cycle of the scientific method - PDCA, and each complete cycle indicating an increase in our knowledge of the system under study. This approach is based on the belief that our knowledge and skills are limited, but improving. Especially at the start of a project, key information may not be known; the
													PDCA” scientific method
													&quot;provides feedback to justify our guesses (hypotheses) and increase our knowledge. Rather than enter "analysis paralysis" to get it perfect the first time, it is better to be approximately right than exactly wrong. With the improved knowledge, we may choose to refine or alter the goal (ideal state). Certainly, the PDCA approach can bring us closer to whatever goal we choose.</p>

                                                    <p align="left">Rate of change, that is, rate of improvement, is a key competitive factor in today's world. PDCA allows for major "jumps" in performance ("breakthroughs" often desired in a Western approach), as well as Kaizen (frequent small improvements). In the United States a PDCA approach is usually associated with a sizable project involving numerous people's time, and thus managers want to see large "breakthrough" improvements to justify the effort expended. However, the scientific method and PDCA apply to all sorts of projects and improvement activities.</p>
