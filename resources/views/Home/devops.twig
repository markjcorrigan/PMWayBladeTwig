          <p>The release management team has been made partially redundant by machines. It is not
            absolute because of two reasons.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You need an owner for the entire release management process that
              cuts across both development and operations.</li>
            <li>Cognitive abilities are very much in demand to ensure that the
              release management process succeeds and aligns with the objectives
              set forth.</li>
          </ul>
          <p align="left">The person who manages the entire release from end to end is the release manager
            and is still necessary. However, the release management role went from being a full-time
            position to a part-time one (statistically speaking), mainly because of the diminished
            work (thanks to automation). Capable release managers are
          <ol>
            <li>Well aware of the customer landscape, the requirements, and to
              an extent the business priorities</li>
            <li>Fully involved in the development and deployment processes</li>
            <li>Understands operations and their acceptance criteria</li>
          </ol>
          <p align="left">The person who could do all this in the past was the product owner (PO), and thus
            that person is a favorite choice for a part-time release manager. POs are an adequate
            choice mainly because of their closeness to the business and to the development
            and operations teams. The person was like a bridge between the two entities and was
            expected to keep the boat going in the most turbulent conditions.</p>
