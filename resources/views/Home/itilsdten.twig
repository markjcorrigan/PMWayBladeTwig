  <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Process_Description">Process Description</span></h2>
  <p>IT Architecture management is not on the list of official ITIL 2011 processes, but ITIL provides guidance on architecture issues as part of a chapter on "technology-related activities", and having a well-defined architecture blueprint in place is very important for IT organizations. So there are good reasons for organizations to define and implement an architecture management process, and at IT Process Maps we have decided to assign clear responsibilities for managing the architecture, which meant introducing a specific Architecture Management process as part of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.it-processmaps.com/products/itil-process-map.html">ITIL&#174; Process Map</a>. </p>
  <p>ITIL does not provide a detailed explanation of all aspects of Architecture Management. A well-structured and up-to-date Enterprise Architecture, however, is commonly regarded as a key element for successfully managing organizations. </p>
  <p>Following the introduction of Design Coordination in <i><b>ITIL 2011</b></i> the information flows have been adapted slightly. The process overview of <a href="/images/itilsdten.jpg" target="_blank" title="It-architecture-management.jpg">ITIL Architecture Management (.JPG)</a> shows the key information flows. </p>
