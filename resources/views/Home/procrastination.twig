  <h3><b></b>Below you will find more detal on the exact steps to follow to stop procrastination:&nbsp; Let's learn how to do it
    now.&nbsp; Ready, Steady, Go!</h3>
  <p>I have found that learning the terms and being able to apply them really helps. <br>
    After reading through this go back to the top of the page and test yourself that you have them pinned down in your memory and can use each concept at will, when you need it. <br>
    The most important ones, the doing ones for me are: "Critical Entrance, Dark Woods, Tipping Pont, Flow and Happy Playground!" Enjoy!</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Here is the definition of the word "procrastination" from a dictionary: <br>
    <span style="font-size: 24px;"><b>pro-cras-ti-na-tion</b></span> <span style="color: #808080; font-size: 16px;">|pr&#601;&#716;krast&#601;&#712;n&#257;SH&#601;n, pr&#333;-|</span> <br>
    noun <br>
    "the action of delaying or postponing something."
  <hr>
  From this advice it appears that your first tip is to <i>avoid procrastination</i>.
  </p>
  <p>Who would have thought that after decades of struggle with procrastination, the dictionary, of all places, would hold the solution.</p>
  <p><i>Avoid procrastination.</i> So elegant in its simplicity.</p>
  <p>While we're here, let's make sure obese people avoid overeating, depressed people avoid apathy, and someone please tell beached whales that they should avoid being out of the ocean!</p>
  <p>No, &quot;avoid procrastination&quot; is only good advice for fake procrastinators - those people that are like; &quot;I totally go on Facebook a few times every day at work - I'm such a procrastinator!&quot; The same people that will say to a real procrastinator something like; &quot;Just don't procrastinate and you'll be fine.&quot;</p>
  <p>The thing that neither the dictionary nor fake procrastinators understand is that for a real procrastinator, procrastination isn't optional - <b>it's something they don't know how to not do!</b></p>
  <p>In college, the sudden unbridled personal freedom was a disaster for me - I did nothing, ever, for any reason. The one exception was that I had to hand in papers from time to time. I would do those the night before, until I realized I could just do them through the night, and I did that until I realized I could actually start them in the early morning on the day they were due. This behavior reached caricature levels when I was unable to start writing my 90-page senior thesis until 72 hours before it was due, an experience that ended with me in the campus doctor's office learning that lack of blood sugar was the reason my hands had gone numb and had curled up, with the stress of my
    endeavor, into tight balls defying my will to complete the work on time. (I did get the thesis in on time. And yes, NO, it was not good work!)</p>
  <p>Even this post took much longer than it should have, because I spent a bunch of hours doing things like seeing <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Jock,_the_Gorilla_(2).jpg" target="_blank">this picture</a> sitting on my desktop, opening it, looking at it for a long time thinking about how easily he could beat me in a fight, then wondering if he could beat a tiger in a fight, then wondering who would win between a lion and a tiger, and then googling that and reading about it for a while (the tiger would win). I have problems!</p>
  <p>To understand why procrastinators procrastinate so much, let's start by understanding a <i>non</i>-procrastinator's brain:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/NP brain.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>Pretty normal, right? Now, let's look at a procrastinator's brain:</p>
  <p> <a href="/images/P brain.png"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/P brain.png" alt="" border="0"></a> </p>
  <p>Notice anything different?</p>
  <p>It seems the Rational Decision Maker in the procrastinator's brain is coexisting with a pet - <b>the Instant Gratification Monkey</b>.</p>
  <p>This would be fine - cute, even - if the Rational Decision Maker knew the first thing about how to own a monkey. But unfortunately, it wasn't a part of his training and he's left completely helpless as the monkey makes it impossible for him to do his job.</p>
  <p> <a href="/images/IGM RDM interacting 1.png"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/IGM RDM interacting 1.png" alt="" border="0"></a> </p>
  <p> <a href="/images/IGM RDM interacting 2.png"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/IGM RDM interacting 2.png" alt="" border="0"></a> </p>
  <p> <a href="/images/IGM RDM interacting 3.png"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/IGM RDM interacting 3.png" alt="" border="0"></a> </p>
  <p> <a href="/images/IGM RDM interacting 4.png"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/IGM RDM interacting 4.png" alt="" border="0"></a> </p>
  <p>The fact is, the Instant Gratification Monkey is the last creature who should be in charge of decisions - he thinks <i>only </i>about the present, ignoring lessons from the past and disregarding the future altogether, and he concerns himself entirely with maximizing the ease and pleasure of the current moment. He doesn't understand the Rational Decision Maker any better than the Rational Decision Maker understands him - why would we continue doing this job, he thinks, when we could stop, which would feel much better. Why would we practice that instrument when it's not fun? Why would we ever use a computer for work when the internet is sitting right there waiting to be played with? He thinks humans are insane trying to achieve their goals when there is so much fun just waiting to be had!</p>
  <p>In the monkey world, he's got it all figured out - if you eat when you're hungry, sleep when you're tired, and don't do anything difficult, you're a pretty successful monkey. The problem for the procrastinator is that he happens to live in the human world, making the Instant Gratification Monkey a highly unqualified navigator. Meanwhile, the Rational Decision Maker, who was trained to make rational decisions, not to deal with competition over the controls, doesn't know how to put up an effective fight - he just feels worse and worse about himself, the more he fails, and the more the suffering procrastinator, whose head he's in, berates him.</p>
  <p>It's a vicious circle and a total mess. And with the monkey in charge, the procrastinator finds himself spending a lot of time in a place called the Dark Playground.</p>
  <p>The Dark Playground is a place every procrastinator knows well. It's a place where leisure activities happen at times <b>when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening</b>. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun because it's completely unearned and the air is filled with <b>guilt</b>, <b>anxiety</b>, <b>self-hatred</b>, and <b>dread</b>. Sometimes the Rational Decision Maker puts his foot down and refuses to let you waste time doing normal leisure things, and since the Instant Gratification Monkey sure as hell isn't gonna let you work, you find yourself in a bizarre purgatory of weird activities where everyone loses.</p>
  <p>And the poor Rational Decision Maker just mopes, trying to figure out how he let the human he's supposed to be in charge of end up here <i>again</i>.</p>
  <p>Given this predicament, how does the procrastinator ever manage to accomplish anything?</p>
  <p>As it turns out, there's one thing that scares the shit out of the Instant Gratification Monkey:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/PM.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>The Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up when a deadline gets too close, or when there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster, or some other scary consequence.</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/PM Scare 1.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/PM Scare 2.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/PM Scare 3.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>The Instant Gratification Monkey, normally unshakable, is terrified of the Panic Monster. How else could you explain the same person who can't write a paper's introductory sentence over a two-week span suddenly having the ability to stay up all night, fighting exhaustion, and being able to write eight pages? Why else would an extraordinarily lazy person begin a rigorous workout routine other than a Panic Monster
    freak-out about becoming less attractive?</p>
  <p>And these are the lucky procrastinators - there are some who don't even respond to the Panic Monster, and in the most desperate moments they end up running up the tree with the monkey, entering a state of self-annihilating shutdown with deep depression lurking in the shadows all around them just waiting to drag them down to catatonic levels of hopelessness and despair.</p>
  <p>Quite a crowd we are.</p>
  <p>Of course, this is no way to live. Even for the procrastinator who does manage to eventually get things done and remain a competent member of society (sort of...), something has to change. Here are the main reasons why:</p>
  <p><b>1) It's unpleasant.</b> Far too much of the procrastinator's precious time is spent toiling in the Dark Playground, time that could have been spent enjoying satisfying, well-earned leisure if things had been done on a more logical schedule. And we all agree that panic isn't much fun for anyone.</p>
  <p><b>2) The procrastinator ultimately sells himself short.</b> He ends up underachieving and fails to reach his potential, which eats away at him over time and fills him with regret and self-loathing.</p>
  <p><b>3) The Have-To-Dos may happen, but not the Want-To-Dos. </b>Even if the procrastinator is in the type of career where the Panic Monster is regularly present and he's able to be fulfilled at work, the other things in life that are important to him - getting in shape, cooking elaborate meals, learning to play the guitar, writing a book, reading, or even making a bold career switch - never happen because the Panic Monster doesn't usually get involved with those things. Undertakings like those expand our experiences, make our lives richer, and bring us a lot of happiness - and for most procrastinators, they get left in the dust.</p>

  <p>Here is a definition that we could use to better describe the word procrastination: <br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 24px;"><b>pro-cras-ti-na-tion</b></span> <span style="color: #808080; font-size: 16px;">|pr&#601;&#716;krast&#601;&#712;n&#257;SH&#601;n, pr&#333;-|</span></span> <br>
    noun <br>
    <i>the action of ruining your own life for no apparent reason</i></p>
  <hr>
  <p>Let me start by saying that I've had just about enough of the irony of battling through crippling procrastination while trying to write posts on procrastination and how to beat it. I've spent the last two weeks being <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw-jTCNZSmY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this guy</a>, who shoots himself in the foot while talking about gun safety, and I look forward to getting back to irony-free procrastination following this post.</p>
  <p>A couple notes before we begin:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm not a professional at any of this, just a lifelong procrastinator who thinks about this topic all the time. I'm still in a total battle with my own habits, but I have made some progress in the last few years, and I'm drawing my thoughts from what's worked for me.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>This post was posted late, not only because it took me 2,000 years to do, but also because I decided that Monday night was an urgent time to open Google Earth, hover a few hundred feet above the southern tip of India, and scroll all the way up India to the top of the country, to &quot;get a better feel for India.&quot; I have problems.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Alright, so in Part 1 above we dove into the everyday inner struggle of the procrastinator to examine the underlying psychology going on. But this week, when we're actually trying to do something about it, we need to dig even deeper. Let's begin by trying to unwrap the procrastinator's psychology and see what's really at the core of things:</p>
  <p>We know about the Instant Gratification Monkey (the part of your brain that makes you procrastinate) and his dominion over the Rational Decision Maker, but what's really happening there?</p>
  <p>The procrastinator is in the bad habit, bordering on addiction, of letting the monkey win. He continues to have the intention to control the monkey, but he puts forth a hapless effort, using the same proven-not-to-work methods he's used for years, and deep down, he knows the monkey will win. He vows to change, but the patterns just stay the same. So why would an otherwise capable person put forth such a lame and futile effort again and again?</p>
  <p><b>The answer is that he <b>has incredibly low confidence</b> when it comes to this part of his life which allows him to become enslaved by a self-defeating, self-fulfilling prophecy. </b>Let's call this self-fulfilling prophecy his Storyline. The procrastinator's Storyline goes something like this:</p>
  <p>For the Have-To-Dos in my life, I'll end up waiting until the last minute, panicking, and then either doing less than my best work or shutting down and not doing anything at all. For the Want-To-Dos in my life, let's be honest - I'll either start one and quit or more likely, I just won't ever get around to it. I.e. based on my past experience (<a href="/home/gamestats" target="_blank">or past production statistics</a>).</i> </p>
  <p>The procrastinator's problems run deep, and it takes something more than &quot;being more self-disciplined&quot; or &quot;changing his bad habits&quot; for him to change his ways - <b>the root of the problem is embedded in his Storyline, and his Storyline is what must change.</b></p>
  <hr>
  <p>Before we talk about how Storylines change, let's examine, concretely, what the procrastinator even wants to change <i>into</i>. What do the right habits even look like, and where exactly will the procrastinator run into trouble?</p>
  <hr>
  <p>There are two components of being able to achieve things in a healthy and effective manner - <b>planning</b> and <b>doing</b>. <br>
    Let's start with the easy one:</p>
  <h2><b>Planning</b></h2>
  <p>Procrastinators love planning, quite simply because <i>planning</i> does not involve <i>doing</i>, and <b>doing</b>, unfortunately, is the procrastinator's Kryptonite.</p>
  <p>But when procrastinators plan, they like to do it in a vague way that doesn't consider <b>the details</b> or the <b>reality</b> too closely, and, what is more important for the procrastinator: their planning leaves them perfectly set up to not actually accomplish anything. A procrastinator's planning session leaves him with a doer's nightmare: <b>A big list of icky, daunting tasks and undertakings.</b></p>
  <p> <a href="/images/icky list.png"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/icky list.png" alt="" border="0"></a> </p>
  <p>A big list of vague and daunting things makes the Instant Gratification Monkey <i>laugh. </i>When you make a list like that, the monkey says, &quot;Oh perfect, this is easy.&quot; Even if your gullible conscious mind believes it intends to accomplish the items on that list in an efficient manner, the monkey knows that in your <i>subconscious</i>, you have no intention of doing so.</p>
  <p>Effective planning, on the other hand, sets you up for <i>success</i>. Its purpose is to do the exact opposite of everything in that sentence:</p>
  <h4><b>Effective planning takes a <span style="color: #ff0000;">big list </span>and selects a <span style="color: #339966;">winner</span>: </b></h4>
  <p>A big list is perhaps an early phase of planning, but planning must end with rigorous prioritizing and <i>one </i>item that emerges as the winner - the item you're going to make your first priority. And the item that wins should be the one that means the most to you - the item that's <i>most important </i>for your happiness. If urgent items are involved, those will have to come first and should be knocked out as quickly as possible in order to make way for the important items (procrastinators love to use unimportant but urgent items as an excuse to forever put off the important ones).</p>
  <h4><b>Effective planning makes an <span style="color: #ff0000;">icky</span> item <span style="color: #339966;">un-icky</span>:</b></h4>
  <p>We all know what an icky item is. An icky item is vague and murky, and you're not really sure where you'd start, how you'd go about doing it, or where you'd get answers to your questions about it.</p>
  <p>So let's say your dream is to make your own app, and you know that if you build a successful app you could quit your job and become a full-time developer. You also think that programming ability is the literacy of the 21st century, and you don't have money to spend outsourcing development anyway, so you decide to anoint &quot;Learn how to code&quot; the winning item on your list - the number one priority. Exciting, right?</p>
  <p>Well, no, because &quot;Learn how to code&quot; is an intensely icky item - and every time you decide it's time to get started, you will coincidentally also decide your inbox needs to be cleaned out and your kitchen floor needs to be mopped, YouTube needs to be consulted etc., ASAP. It'll never end up happening.</p>
  <p>To un-icky the item, you need to <b>read</b>, <b>research</b>, and <b>ask questions</b> to find out exactly how one learns how to code, the specific means necessary for each step along the way, and how long each one should take. Un-ickying a list item turns it from this:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/icky task.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>Into this:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/unicky task.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <h4><b>Effective planning turns <span style="color: #ff0000;">a daunting item</span> into <span style="color: #008000;">a series of small, clear, manageable tasks</span>:</b></h4>
  <p>Icky combines with Daunting into an Instant Gratification Monkey steroid potion. And just because you un-icky an item, it doesn't mean it's still not horribly big and daunting. The key to de-dauntifying an item is to absorb this fact:</p>
  <p><i>A remarkable, glorious achievement is just what a long series of unremarkable, unglorious tasks looks like from far away.</i></p>
  <p><img class="alignright" src="/images/idea man.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>No one &quot;builds a house.&quot; They lay one brick again and again and again and the end result is a house. Procrastinators are great visionaries - they love to fantasize about the beautiful mansion they will one day have built - but what they need to be are gritty construction workers, who methodically lay one brick after the other, day after day, without giving up, until a house is built.</p>
  <p>Nearly every big undertaking can be boiled down to a core unit of progress - its brick. A 45-minute gym visit is the brick of getting in great shape. A 30-minute practice session is the brick of becoming a great guitarist.</p>
  <p>The average day in a wannabe author's week and a real author's week looks almost the same. The real author writes a couple pages, laying a brick, and the wannabe author writes nothing. 98% of their day is otherwise identical. But a year later, the real author has a completed first draft of a book and the wannabe author has&#8230;nothing.</p>
  <p>It's all about the bricks!</p>
  <img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/images/building_brick_wall_pa_300_clr.gif">
  <p>And the good news is, laying one brick isn't daunting. But <b>bricks do require scheduling</b>. So the final step in planning is to make a Brick Timeline, which slots bricks into the calendar. The slots are non-negotiable and non-cancellable - after all, it's your first priority and the thing that matters most to you, isn't it? The most important date is the first one. You can't start learning to code &quot;in November.&quot; But you <i>can </i>start learning to code on November 21st from 6:00 &#8211; 7:00pm.</p>
  <p>Now you're effectively planned - just follow the schedule and you'll be a programmer. Only thing left is to <i><b>do</b></i>&#8230;</p>
  <h2><b>Doing</b></h2>
  <p>It's not that procrastinators don't like the <i>concept </i>of doing. They look at the bricks on their calendar and they think, &quot;Great, this will be fun.&quot; And that's because when they <i>picture</i> the moment in the future when they sit down and knock out a work session, they picture things without the presence of the Instant Gratification Monkey. Procrastinators' visions of future scenarios never seem to include the monkey!</p>
  <p>But when the actual moment arrives to begin that scheduled brick-laying, the procrastinator does what the procrastinator does best - he lets the monkey take over and ruin everything.</p>
  <p>And since we just stressed above that all achievement boils down to the ability to lay that one brick during that slot when it's on your schedule, we seem to have isolated the core struggle here. Let's examine this specific challenge of laying a single brick:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/dark woods.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>So this diagram represents the challenge at hand anytime you take on a task, whether it's making a PowerPoint for work, going on a jog, working on a script, or anything else you do in your life. The Critical Entrance is where you go to officially start work on the task, the Dark Woods are the process of actually doing the work, and once you finish, you're rewarded by ending up in The Happy Playground - a place where you feel satisfaction and where leisure time is pleasant and rewarding because you got something hard done. You occasionally even end up super-engaged with what you're working on and enter a state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" target="_blank">Flow</a>, where you're so blissfully immersed in the task that you lose track of time.</p>
  <p>Those paths look something like this:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/dark woods pro good.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>Sounds pretty simple, right?</p>
  <p>Well unfortunately for procrastinators, they tend to miss out on both The Happy Playground and Flow.</p>
  <p>For example, here's a procrastinator that never even gets started on the task he's supposed to do, because he never makes it through the Critical Entrance. Instead, he spends hours wallowing in The Dark Playground, hating himself:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/dark woods pro 1.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>Here's a procrastinator who gets started on the task, but she can't stay focused, and she keeps taking long breaks to play on the internet and make food. She doesn't end up finishing the task:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/dark woods pro 2.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>Here's a procrastinator who couldn't bring himself to get started, even though a work deadline was approaching, and he spent hours in The Dark Playground, knowing the looming deadline was drawing near and he was only making his life harder by not starting. Eventually, the deadline got so close, the Panic Monster suddenly came roaring into the room, freaking him out and causing him to fly through the task to hit the deadline.</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/dark woods pro 3.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>After he finishes, he feels decent because he accomplished something, but he's also not that pleased because he knows he did an underwhelming job on the project because he had to rush so much, and he feels like he wasted most of his day procrastinating for no reason. This lands him in Mixed Feelings Park.</p>
  <p>So if you're a procrastinator, let's look at what you need to do to get on the right path, one that will leave you much happier.</p>
  <p>The first thing you <i>must</i> do is make it through the Critical Entrance. This means stopping whatever you're doing when it's time to begin the task, putting away all distractions, and getting started. It sounds simple, but this is the hardest part. This is where the Instant Gratification Monkey puts up his fiercest resistance:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/The Critical Entrance.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>The monkey absolutely <i>hates</i> stopping something fun to start something hard, and this is where you need to be the strongest. If you can get started and force the monkey into the Dark Woods, you've broken a bit of his will.</p>
  <p>Of course, he's not going to give up anytime soon.</p>
  <p>The Dark Woods is where you are when you're working. It's not a fun place to be, and the Instant Gratification Monkey wants nothing to do with it. To make things harder, the Dark Woods is <i>surrounded</i> by the Dark Playground, one of the monkey's favorite places, and since he can see how close it is, he'll try as hard as he can to leave the Dark Woods.</p>
  <p>There will also be times when you bump into a tree! <br>
    <img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/images/treelarger.jpg"> <br>
    Maybe the jog is taking you on an uphill street, maybe you need to use an Excel formula you don't know, maybe that song you're writing just isn't coming together the way you thought it would - and this is when the monkey will make his boldest attempt at an escape.</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/Pathways.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>It makes no sense to leave the Dark Woods in favor of the Dark Playground - they're both dark. They both suck to be in, but the big difference is the Dark Woods leads to happiness and the Dark Playground leads only to more misery. But the Instant Gratification Monkey isn't logical and to him, the Dark Playground seems like much more fun.</p>
  <p>The good news is, if you can power through a bit of the Dark Woods, something funny (amazing) happens. Making progress on a task produces positive feelings of accomplishment and raises your self-esteem. The monkey gains his strength off of low self-esteem, and when you feel a jolt of self-satisfaction, the monkey finds a High Self-Esteem Banana in his path. It doesn't quell his resistance entirely, but it goes a long way to distracting him for a while, and you'll find that the urge to procrastinate has diminished.</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/Pathways banana.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>Then, if you continue along, something magical happens. Once you get 2/3 or 3/4 of the way through a task, especially if it's going well, you start to feel great about things and suddenly, the end is in sight. This is a key tipping point - </p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/dark woods tipping point.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>The Tipping Point is important because it's not just you who can smell the Happy Playground up ahead - <i>the monkey can smell it too</i>. The monkey doesn't care if his instant gratification comes alongside you or at your expense, he just loves things that are easy and fun. Once you hit the Tipping Point, the monkey becomes <i>more interested in getting to the Happy Playground than the Dark Playground.</i> When this happens, you lose all impulse to procrastinate and now both you and the monkey are speeding toward the finish.</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/running.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>Before you know it, you're done, and you're in the Happy Playground. Now, for the first time in a while, you and the monkey are a<i> team. </i>You both want to have fun, and it feels great because it's <i>earned</i>. When you and the monkey are on a team, you're almost always happy.</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/happy playground.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>The other thing that might happen when you pass the Tipping Point, depending on the type of task and how well it's going, is that you might start feeling <i>fantastic</i> about what you're working on, so fantastic that continuing to work sounds like <i>much</i> more fun than stopping to do leisure activities. You've become obsessed with the task and you lose interest in basically everything else, including food and time - this is called Flow. Flow is not only a blissful feeling, it's usually when you do great things.</p>
  <p>The monkey is just as addicted to the bliss as you are, and you two are again a team.</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/flow.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>Fighting through to the Tipping Point is hard, but what makes procrastination <i>so</i> hard to beat is that the Instant Gratification Monkey has a terribly short-term memory - even if you wildly succeed on Monday, when you begin a task on Tuesday, the monkey has forgotten everything and will again resist entering the Dark Woods or working through them.</p>
  <p>And that's why persistence is such a critical component of success. Laying each brick yields an inner struggle - and in the end, your ability to win this very specific struggle and lay brick after brick, day after day, is what lies at the core of a procrastinator's struggle to gain control over his world.</p>
  <p>So that's what needs to happen - but if procrastination could be solved by reading this, it wouldn't be such a large problem in so many people's lives. There's only one way to truly beat procrastination:</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><b>You need to prove to yourself that you can do it.</b></span></p>
  <p>You need to show yourself you can do it, not tell yourself. Things will change when you show yourself that they can. Until then, you won't believe it, and nothing will change. Think of yourself like a basketball player on a cold streak. For basketball players, it's all about confidence, and an ice cold shooter can tell himself 1000 times, &quot;I'm a great shooter, I'm going to hit this next one,&quot; but it's not until he physically hits a shot that his confidence goes up and his touch comes back.</p>
  <p>So how do you start hitting shots?</p>
  <p><b>1) Try to internalize the fact that everything you do is a choice. </b></p>
  <p>Start by thinking about the terms we've used here, and if they resonated with you, write them down. I have put them at the top of the page for you! Part of the reason I assigned terms to so many of these feelings or phenomena - the Instant Gratification Monkey, the Rational Decision Maker, the Panic Monster, the Dark Playground, Ickiness, Bricks, the Critical Entrance, the Dark Woods, the Tipping Point, the Happy Playground, Flow, your Storyline - is that terms help you clarify the reality of the choices you're making. It helps expose bad choices and highlights when it's most critical to make good ones.</p>
  <p><b>2) Create methods to help you defeat the monkey. </b></p>
  <p>Some possible methods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Solicit external support by telling one or more friends or family members about a goal you're trying to accomplish and asking them to hold you to it. If that's hard for whatever reason, email it to me - I'm a stranger (mark@pmway.co.za) - and just typing out a goal and sending it to a real person can help make it more real. (Some experts argue that telling people in your life about a goal can be counterproductive, so this depends on your particular situation.)</li>
    <li>Create a Panic Monster if there's not already one in place - if you're trying to finish an album, schedule a performance for a few months from now, book a space, and send out an invitation to a group of people.</li>
    <li>If you really want to start a business, quitting your job makes the Panic Monster your new roommate.</li>
    <li>If you're trying to write a consistent blog, put &quot;new post every Tuesday&quot; at the top of the page&#8230;</li>
    <li>Leave post-it notes for yourself, reminding you to make good choices.</li>
    <li>Set an alarm to remind yourself to start a task, or to remind you of the stakes.</li>
    <li>Minimize distractions by all means necessary. If TV's a huge problem, sell your TV. If the internet's a huge problem, get a second computer for work that has Wifi disabled, and turn your phone on Airplane Mode during work sessions.</li>
    <li>Lock yourself into something - put down a non-refundable deposit for lessons or a membership.</li>
    <li>Take a look at Trello. The Trello board is free and will allow you to create TO DO and DO and DONE columns to manage your tasks. <br>
      <a href="/homeviewvideo/resources/kanban.mp4" target="_blank ">The video here</a> explains how to go about this in a way that will work.<br>
      <img alt=" " class="img-fluid " src="/images/trello.jpg " ></li>
  </ul>
  <p>And if the methods you set up aren't working, change them. Set a reminder for a month from now that says,
    &quot;Have things improved? If not, change my methods.&quot;</p>
  <p><b>3) Aim for slow, steady progress - Storylines are rewritten one page at a time.</b></p>
  <p>The best way is step by step keeping yourself "in gradient" <br>
    <img alt=" " class="img-fluid " src="/images/stepbystep.png " ><br>
    <br>
    <b>If you are feeling like this...</b><img alt=" " class="img-fluid " src="/images/toosteep.png " ><br>
    <br>
    <b>then possibly milestones are too much</b><br>
    <img alt=" " class="img-fluid " src="/images/milestone1.png " > <br>
    <br>
    <b>and inch pebbles (smaller - un-icky- bricks) are required!</b>&nbsp; <img alt=" " class="img-fluid " src="/images/inchpebbles.png " ></p>

                      parts with small objects. Important parts and principles should be <i> demonstrated
                      in clay</i>. The student simply makes a representation in clay of the things described and

                      he is learning about car motors. Under supervision he is simply made to touch
                      parts of a motor pointed out by another student. Each time he touches that part
                      he is acknowledged and a new part is chosen. The student running this drill
                      would simply point out a part and not demand the student explain anything
                      about it but simply have him touch it. By keeping this up for a while the
                      student will feel his 'lack of mass' is being repaired and will feel more
                      relaxed and happy about the whole subject. As a result much or all of the

                      Too steep a gradient applies especially to practical skills and actions - what
                      we call doingness. But it also applies to understanding itself.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa"><b>Reactions:</b> If you push a student along on too
                      steep a gradient he will experience one or more of the following mental and physiological
                      reactions: confusion, disorientation and being spun around. The parts he is
                      trying to learn seem to be less solid and in random motion.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa">Too steep a gradient means it was too much of a jump. He
                      didn't understand what he was doing or was supposed to do and he was started on
                      the next step or skill level. Routinely he will feel the new level is where his
                      difficulties are. He will assign it all to this new level. But the truth is
                      that is was on the previous level. The remedy is to put him one step back and
                      really make him able to perform that skill well. The actual missed gradient was
                      at the tail end of the previous level. As stated, this applies especially to
                      doingness, to practical actions.<br>
                      If we again use repairing of motors as an example, the student may have learned
                      how to use wrenches and then start to learn how to take a motor apart. Let's say
                      he finds this awfully confusing. Chances are he does not know enough about using
                      the wrenches he is supposed to use.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa"><b>Remedy: </b> The remedy is to
                      put him back on the step he didn't master. Have him practice using the wrenches
                      on different knots and bolts without adding the complexities of a whole motor to
                      it. Is he holding the wrench right? Does he know what to do to overcome a resistant
                      knot or bolt? Does he know how to loosen up a rusty bolt with chemicals, and so
                      on?</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa">Sometimes an instructor has to be inventive in realizing
                      what simpler skills go into a more complicated skill. Maybe the materials
                      themselves did not predict the type of difficulties and missing skills the
                      student could get hung up on. A good instructor will be able to remedy this and
                      break a complicated action down into the component parts. He then has the
                      student practice each little skill before he is made to put it all together.
                      Instructors mastering this little point are often looked upon with awe as they
                      can teach the &quot;most clumsy and stupid students&quot; to become competent.
                      It does take an ability to observe and analyze, but it really does not take
                      genius to overcome these things as an instructor.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa">This phenomenon of the skipped gradient is somewhat
                      similar to the last phenomenon, the misunderstood word, but it stands alone as
                      it is not rooted in misunderstood words, but in too much motion or randomity for
                      the student to handle. It's the complexity of the action that throws him off.</font></p>

                      with even simple facts.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa">Ultimately this barrier is what is behind students that 'blow',
                      meaning they leave course or give up on the study that otherwise seems very
                      beneficial to them.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa">The student may not necessarily blow as a result of the
                      first two phenomena. They may make him feel uncomfortable mentally and
                      physically, but they don't produce blows. It takes bypassed definitions to
                      bring that about.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa">The bypassed definition is the most important barrier. It
                      affects human relationships, the mind, and subjects. It is a prime element of
                      aptitude or lack of aptitude and it's what psychologists have been trying to
                      test for years without knowing exactly what it was.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa">It's the definitions of words. Misunderstood words and
                      symbols. That's all it goes back to.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa">This produces a vast variety of mental effects and is all
                      by itself the prime factor involved in stupidity and the prime factor
                      involved in many other mental phenomena.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa">If a person didn't have misunderstoods in a subject he
                      could <i> perform</i> in that field. His <i>talent </i>might or might not be

                      inability to approach pastry making is ultimately based on having misunderstoods

                    <p><font face="Ottawa">There exist a number of methods of Word Clearing that

                      misunderstoods opens the door to education and understanding. Then re-doing the
                      subject with knowledge about these three barriers to study makes it possible for
                      the student to become competent and actually perform in the field. And that is

        <h3>Lack of Mass</h3>
        <br>
        <p>To be able to study new things the student needs pictures or the physical objects involved.</p>
        <h5>The Symptoms</h5>
        <p>The student will typically experience one or more of these reactions: It will make him feel squashed, it will <b>make him feel spinny and confused</b>; he can <b>experience a 'dead' feeling, feel bored, or exasperated</b>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card-header collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapsed2"> <a class="card-title"> Too Steep a Gradient: </a> </div>

        <h3>Too Steep a Gradient</h3>
        <br>
        <p>One is going ahead to the next step before mastering the previous one. This phenomenon applies especially to doingness, but also to understanding. If a student is studying barn building he could be taught all about power tools before mastering the basics of carpentry and the whole subject would be too confusing. This would be an example of too steep a gradient.</p>
        <h5>The Symptoms</h5>
        <p>If you push a student along on too steep a gradient he will experience one or more of the following mental and physiological reactions: <b>confusion, disorientation and being spun around</b>. The <b>parts he is trying to learn seem to be less solid and in random motion</b>.</p>

        <h3> Bypassing Misunderstoods</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The third barrier to study is the most important one. It is bypassing undefined words or misunderstanding words. This apparently innocent oversight can cause the most serious reactions on the part of the student. Understanding a text, whether the written word or spoken instructions, depends utterly upon the student understanding all the words. The moment the student goes past misunderstood words and symbols he will experience a 'mental blank' and find the instructions incomprehensible. When this accumulates due to many misunderstoods he will find the whole subject incomprehensible and become hostile to it.</p>
        <h5>The Symptoms</h5>
        <p>Bypassing a definition <b>gives the student a blank feeling or washed out feeling. It is a sort of 'not-there' feeling. It can develop into a nervous hysteria, sleepiness (even completely falling asleep), or utter non-comprehension, and violent disagreement with even simple facts</b>.

          Ultimately this barrier is <b>what is behind students that 'blow'</b>, meaning they leave course or give up on the study that otherwise seems very beneficial to them.</p>

  <p>In the same way a great achievement happens unglorious brick by unglorious brick, a deeply-engrained habit like procrastination doesn't change all at once, it changes one modest improvement at a time. Remember, this is all about showing yourself you can do it, so the key isn't to be perfect, but to simply <i>improve</i>. The author who writes one page a day has written a book after a year. The procrastinator who gets slightly better every week is a totally changed person a year later.</p>
  <p>So don't think about going from A to Z - just start with A to B. Change the Storyline from &quot;I procrastinate on every hard task I do&quot; to &quot;Once a week, I do a hard task without procrastinating.&quot; If you can do that, you've started an upward (pro survival) <a href="/home/gamestats" target="_blank "><i>trend</i></a>. I'm still a wretched procrastinator, but I'm definitely better than I was last year, so I feel hopeful about the future.<br>
    <br>
    Remember defeating procrastination is the same thing as gaining control over your own life. So much of what makes people happy or unhappy
    - their level of fulfillment and satisfaction, their self-esteem, the regrets they carry with them, the amount of free time they have to dedicate to their relationships
    - is severely affected by procrastination. So it's worthy of being taken dead seriously, and the time to start improving is now.</p>
  <p>Note:  If interested:  Clicking on the "<a href="/home/gamestats" target="_blank">Conditions Scale image here</a>" allows you to drill down inot some of the cool "technology" behind the stuff above.  I.e. how do you want to survive, going forward?  Well, or icky?!</p>

  <h3><b></b>Below you will find more detal on the exact steps to follow to stop procrastination:&nbsp; Let's learn how to do it
    now.&nbsp; Ready, Steady, Go!</h3>
  <p>I have found that learning the terms and being able to apply them really helps. <br>
    After reading through this go back to the top of the page and test yourself that you have them pinned down in your memory and can use each concept at will, when you need it. <br>
    The most important ones, the doing ones for me are: "Critical Entrance, Dark Woods, Tipping Pont, Flow and Happy Playground!" Enjoy!</p>

  <p>Here is the definition of the word "procrastination" from a dictionary: <br>
    <span style="font-size: 24px;"><b>pro-cras-ti-na-tion</b></span> <span style="color: #808080; font-size: 16px;">|pr&#601;&#716;krast&#601;&#712;n&#257;SH&#601;n, pr&#333;-|</span> <br>
    noun <br>
    "the action of delaying or postponing something."
  <hr>
  From this advice it appears that your first tip is to <i>avoid procrastination</i>.
  </p>
  <p>Who would have thought that after decades of struggle with procrastination, the dictionary, of all places, would hold the solution.</p>
  <p><i>Avoid procrastination.</i> So elegant in its simplicity.</p>
  <p>While we're here, let's make sure obese people avoid overeating, depressed people avoid apathy, and someone please tell beached whales that they should avoid being out of the ocean!</p>
  <p>No, &quot;avoid procrastination&quot; is only good advice for fake procrastinators - those people that are like; &quot;I totally go on Facebook a few times every day at work - I'm such a procrastinator!&quot; The same people that will say to a real procrastinator something like; &quot;Just don't procrastinate and you'll be fine.&quot;</p>
  <p>The thing that neither the dictionary nor fake procrastinators understand is that for a real procrastinator, procrastination isn't optional - <b>it's something they don't know how to not do!</b></p>
  <p>In college, the sudden unbridled personal freedom was a disaster for me - I did nothing, ever, for any reason. The one exception was that I had to hand in papers from time to time. I would do those the night before, until I realized I could just do them through the night, and I did that until I realized I could actually start them in the early morning on the day they were due. This behavior reached caricature levels when I was unable to start writing my 90-page senior thesis until 72 hours before it was due, an experience that ended with me in the campus doctor's office learning that lack of blood sugar was the reason my hands had gone numb and had curled up, with the stress of my
    endeavor, into tight balls defying my will to complete the work on time. (I did get the thesis in on time. And yes, NO, it was not good work!)</p>
  <p>Even this post took much longer than it should have, because I spent a bunch of hours doing things like seeing <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Jock,_the_Gorilla_(2).jpg" target="_blank">this picture</a> sitting on my desktop, opening it, looking at it for a long time thinking about how easily he could beat me in a fight, then wondering if he could beat a tiger in a fight, then wondering who would win between a lion and a tiger, and then googling that and reading about it for a while (the tiger would win). I have problems!</p>
  <p>To understand why procrastinators procrastinate so much, let's start by understanding a <i>non</i>-procrastinator's brain:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/NP brain.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>Pretty normal, right? Now, let's look at a procrastinator's brain:</p>
  <p> <a href="/images/P brain.png"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/P brain.png" alt="" border="0"></a> </p>
  <p>Notice anything different?</p>
  <p>It seems the Rational Decision Maker in the procrastinator's brain is coexisting with a pet - <b>the Instant Gratification Monkey</b>.</p>
  <p>This would be fine - cute, even - if the Rational Decision Maker knew the first thing about how to own a monkey. But unfortunately, it wasn't a part of his training and he's left completely helpless as the monkey makes it impossible for him to do his job.</p>
  <p> <a href="/images/IGM RDM interacting 1.png"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/IGM RDM interacting 1.png" alt="" border="0"></a> </p>
  <p> <a href="/images/IGM RDM interacting 2.png"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/IGM RDM interacting 2.png" alt="" border="0"></a> </p>
  <p> <a href="/images/IGM RDM interacting 3.png"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/IGM RDM interacting 3.png" alt="" border="0"></a> </p>
  <p> <a href="/images/IGM RDM interacting 4.png"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/IGM RDM interacting 4.png" alt="" border="0"></a> </p>
  <p>The fact is, the Instant Gratification Monkey is the last creature who should be in charge of decisions - he thinks <i>only </i>about the present, ignoring lessons from the past and disregarding the future altogether, and he concerns himself entirely with maximizing the ease and pleasure of the current moment. He doesn't understand the Rational Decision Maker any better than the Rational Decision Maker understands him - why would we continue doing this job, he thinks, when we could stop, which would feel much better. Why would we practice that instrument when it's not fun? Why would we ever use a computer for work when the internet is sitting right there waiting to be played with? He thinks humans are insane trying to achieve their goals when there is so much fun just waiting to be had!</p>
  <p>In the monkey world, he's got it all figured out - if you eat when you're hungry, sleep when you're tired, and don't do anything difficult, you're a pretty successful monkey. The problem for the procrastinator is that he happens to live in the human world, making the Instant Gratification Monkey a highly unqualified navigator. Meanwhile, the Rational Decision Maker, who was trained to make rational decisions, not to deal with competition over the controls, doesn't know how to put up an effective fight - he just feels worse and worse about himself, the more he fails, and the more the suffering procrastinator, whose head he's in, berates him.</p>
  <p>It's a vicious circle and a total mess. And with the monkey in charge, the procrastinator finds himself spending a lot of time in a place called the Dark Playground.</p>
  <p>The Dark Playground is a place every procrastinator knows well. It's a place where leisure activities happen at times <b>when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening</b>. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun because it's completely unearned and the air is filled with <b>guilt</b>, <b>anxiety</b>, <b>self-hatred</b>, and <b>dread</b>. Sometimes the Rational Decision Maker puts his foot down and refuses to let you waste time doing normal leisure things, and since the Instant Gratification Monkey sure as hell isn't gonna let you work, you find yourself in a bizarre purgatory of weird activities where everyone loses.</p>
  <p>And the poor Rational Decision Maker just mopes, trying to figure out how he let the human he's supposed to be in charge of end up here <i>again</i>.</p>
  <p>Given this predicament, how does the procrastinator ever manage to accomplish anything?</p>
  <p>As it turns out, there's one thing that scares the shit out of the Instant Gratification Monkey:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/PM.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>The Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up when a deadline gets too close, or when there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster, or some other scary consequence.</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/PM Scare 1.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/PM Scare 2.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/PM Scare 3.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>The Instant Gratification Monkey, normally unshakable, is terrified of the Panic Monster. How else could you explain the same person who can't write a paper's introductory sentence over a two-week span suddenly having the ability to stay up all night, fighting exhaustion, and being able to write eight pages? Why else would an extraordinarily lazy person begin a rigorous workout routine other than a Panic Monster
    freak-out about becoming less attractive?</p>
  <p>And these are the lucky procrastinators - there are some who don't even respond to the Panic Monster, and in the most desperate moments they end up running up the tree with the monkey, entering a state of self-annihilating shutdown with deep depression lurking in the shadows all around them just waiting to drag them down to catatonic levels of hopelessness and despair.</p>
  <p>Quite a crowd we are.</p>
  <p>Of course, this is no way to live. Even for the procrastinator who does manage to eventually get things done and remain a competent member of society (sort of...), something has to change. Here are the main reasons why:</p>
  <p><b>1) It's unpleasant.</b> Far too much of the procrastinator's precious time is spent toiling in the Dark Playground, time that could have been spent enjoying satisfying, well-earned leisure if things had been done on a more logical schedule. And we all agree that panic isn't much fun for anyone.</p>
  <p><b>2) The procrastinator ultimately sells himself short.</b> He ends up underachieving and fails to reach his potential, which eats away at him over time and fills him with regret and self-loathing.</p>
  <p><b>3) The Have-To-Dos may happen, but not the Want-To-Dos. </b>Even if the procrastinator is in the type of career where the Panic Monster is regularly present and he's able to be fulfilled at work, the other things in life that are important to him - getting in shape, cooking elaborate meals, learning to play the guitar, writing a book, reading, or even making a bold career switch - never happen because the Panic Monster doesn't usually get involved with those things. Undertakings like those expand our experiences, make our lives richer, and bring us a lot of happiness - and for most procrastinators, they get left in the dust.</p>

  <hr>
  <p>Here is a definition that we could use to better describe the word procrastination: <br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 24px;"><b>pro-cras-ti-na-tion</b></span> <span style="color: #808080; font-size: 16px;">|pr&#601;&#716;krast&#601;&#712;n&#257;SH&#601;n, pr&#333;-|</span></span> <br>
    noun <br>
    <i>the action of ruining your own life for no apparent reason</i></p>
  <hr>
  <p>Let me start by saying that I've had just about enough of the irony of battling through crippling procrastination while trying to write posts on procrastination and how to beat it. I've spent the last two weeks being <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw-jTCNZSmY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this guy</a>, who shoots himself in the foot while talking about gun safety, and I look forward to getting back to irony-free procrastination following this post.</p>
  <p>A couple notes before we begin:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm not a professional at any of this, just a lifelong procrastinator who thinks about this topic all the time. I'm still in a total battle with my own habits, but I have made some progress in the last few years, and I'm drawing my thoughts from what's worked for me.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>This post was posted late, not only because it took me 2,000 years to do, but also because I decided that Monday night was an urgent time to open Google Earth, hover a few hundred feet above the southern tip of India, and scroll all the way up India to the top of the country, to &quot;get a better feel for India.&quot; I have problems.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Alright, so in Part 1 above we dove into the everyday inner struggle of the procrastinator to examine the underlying psychology going on. But this week, when we're actually trying to do something about it, we need to dig even deeper. Let's begin by trying to unwrap the procrastinator's psychology and see what's really at the core of things:</p>
  <p>We know about the Instant Gratification Monkey (the part of your brain that makes you procrastinate) and his dominion over the Rational Decision Maker, but what's really happening there?</p>
  <p>The procrastinator is in the bad habit, bordering on addiction, of letting the monkey win. He continues to have the intention to control the monkey, but he puts forth a hapless effort, using the same proven-not-to-work methods he's used for years, and deep down, he knows the monkey will win. He vows to change, but the patterns just stay the same. So why would an otherwise capable person put forth such a lame and futile effort again and again?</p>
  <p><b>The answer is that he <b>has incredibly low confidence</b> when it comes to this part of his life which allows him to become enslaved by a self-defeating, self-fulfilling prophecy. </b>Let's call this self-fulfilling prophecy his Storyline. The procrastinator's Storyline goes something like this:</p>
  <p>For the Have-To-Dos in my life, I'll end up waiting until the last minute, panicking, and then either doing less than my best work or shutting down and not doing anything at all. For the Want-To-Dos in my life, let's be honest - I'll either start one and quit or more likely, I just won't ever get around to it. I.e. based on my past experience (<a href="/home/gamestats" target="_blank">or past production statistics</a>).</i> </p>
  <p>The procrastinator's problems run deep, and it takes something more than &quot;being more self-disciplined&quot; or &quot;changing his bad habits&quot; for him to change his ways - <b>the root of the problem is embedded in his Storyline, and his Storyline is what must change.</b></p>
  <hr>
  <p>Before we talk about how Storylines change, let's examine, concretely, what the procrastinator even wants to change <i>into</i>. What do the right habits even look like, and where exactly will the procrastinator run into trouble?</p>
  <hr>
  <p>There are two components of being able to achieve things in a healthy and effective manner - <b>planning</b> and <b>doing</b>. <br>
    Let's start with the easy one:</p>
  <h2><b>Planning</b></h2>
  <p>Procrastinators love planning, quite simply because <i>planning</i> does not involve <i>doing</i>, and <b>doing</b>, unfortunately, is the procrastinator's Kryptonite.</p>
  <p>But when procrastinators plan, they like to do it in a vague way that doesn't consider <b>the details</b> or the <b>reality</b> too closely, and, what is more important for the procrastinator: their planning leaves them perfectly set up to not actually accomplish anything. A procrastinator's planning session leaves him with a doer's nightmare: <b>A big list of icky, daunting tasks and undertakings.</b></p>
  <p> <a href="/images/icky list.png"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/icky list.png" alt="" border="0"></a> </p>
  <p>A big list of vague and daunting things makes the Instant Gratification Monkey <i>laugh. </i>When you make a list like that, the monkey says, &quot;Oh perfect, this is easy.&quot; Even if your gullible conscious mind believes it intends to accomplish the items on that list in an efficient manner, the monkey knows that in your <i>subconscious</i>, you have no intention of doing so.</p>
  <p>Effective planning, on the other hand, sets you up for <i>success</i>. Its purpose is to do the exact opposite of everything in that sentence:</p>
  <h4><b>Effective planning takes a <span style="color: #ff0000;">big list </span>and selects a <span style="color: #339966;">winner</span>: </b></h4>
  <p>A big list is perhaps an early phase of planning, but planning must end with rigorous prioritizing and <i>one </i>item that emerges as the winner - the item you're going to make your first priority. And the item that wins should be the one that means the most to you - the item that's <i>most important </i>for your happiness. If urgent items are involved, those will have to come first and should be knocked out as quickly as possible in order to make way for the important items (procrastinators love to use unimportant but urgent items as an excuse to forever put off the important ones).</p>
  <h4><b>Effective planning makes an <span style="color: #ff0000;">icky</span> item <span style="color: #339966;">un-icky</span>:</b></h4>
  <p>We all know what an icky item is. An icky item is vague and murky, and you're not really sure where you'd start, how you'd go about doing it, or where you'd get answers to your questions about it.</p>
  <p>So let's say your dream is to make your own app, and you know that if you build a successful app you could quit your job and become a full-time developer. You also think that programming ability is the literacy of the 21st century, and you don't have money to spend outsourcing development anyway, so you decide to anoint &quot;Learn how to code&quot; the winning item on your list - the number one priority. Exciting, right?</p>
  <p>Well, no, because &quot;Learn how to code&quot; is an intensely icky item - and every time you decide it's time to get started, you will coincidentally also decide your inbox needs to be cleaned out and your kitchen floor needs to be mopped, YouTube needs to be consulted etc., ASAP. It'll never end up happening.</p>
  <p>To un-icky the item, you need to <b>read</b>, <b>research</b>, and <b>ask questions</b> to find out exactly how one learns how to code, the specific means necessary for each step along the way, and how long each one should take. Un-ickying a list item turns it from this:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/icky task.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>Into this:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/unicky task.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <h4><b>Effective planning turns <span style="color: #ff0000;">a daunting item</span> into <span style="color: #008000;">a series of small, clear, manageable tasks</span>:</b></h4>
  <p>Icky combines with Daunting into an Instant Gratification Monkey steroid potion. And just because you un-icky an item, it doesn't mean it's still not horribly big and daunting. The key to de-dauntifying an item is to absorb this fact:</p>
  <p><i>A remarkable, glorious achievement is just what a long series of unremarkable, unglorious tasks looks like from far away.</i></p>
  <p><img class="alignright" src="/images/idea man.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>No one &quot;builds a house.&quot; They lay one brick again and again and again and the end result is a house. Procrastinators are great visionaries - they love to fantasize about the beautiful mansion they will one day have built - but what they need to be are gritty construction workers, who methodically lay one brick after the other, day after day, without giving up, until a house is built.</p>
  <p>Nearly every big undertaking can be boiled down to a core unit of progress - its brick. A 45-minute gym visit is the brick of getting in great shape. A 30-minute practice session is the brick of becoming a great guitarist.</p>
  <p>The average day in a wannabe author's week and a real author's week looks almost the same. The real author writes a couple pages, laying a brick, and the wannabe author writes nothing. 98% of their day is otherwise identical. But a year later, the real author has a completed first draft of a book and the wannabe author has&#8230;nothing.</p>
  <p>It's all about the bricks!</p>
  <img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/images/building_brick_wall_pa_300_clr.gif">
  <p>And the good news is, laying one brick isn't daunting. But <b>bricks do require scheduling</b>. So the final step in planning is to make a Brick Timeline, which slots bricks into the calendar. The slots are non-negotiable and non-cancellable - after all, it's your first priority and the thing that matters most to you, isn't it? The most important date is the first one. You can't start learning to code &quot;in November.&quot; But you <i>can </i>start learning to code on November 21st from 6:00 &#8211; 7:00pm.</p>
  <p>Now you're effectively planned - just follow the schedule and you'll be a programmer. Only thing left is to <i><b>do</b></i>&#8230;</p>
  <h2><b>Doing</b></h2>
  <p>It's not that procrastinators don't like the <i>concept </i>of doing. They look at the bricks on their calendar and they think, &quot;Great, this will be fun.&quot; And that's because when they <i>picture</i> the moment in the future when they sit down and knock out a work session, they picture things without the presence of the Instant Gratification Monkey. Procrastinators' visions of future scenarios never seem to include the monkey!</p>
  <p>But when the actual moment arrives to begin that scheduled brick-laying, the procrastinator does what the procrastinator does best - he lets the monkey take over and ruin everything.</p>
  <p>And since we just stressed above that all achievement boils down to the ability to lay that one brick during that slot when it's on your schedule, we seem to have isolated the core struggle here. Let's examine this specific challenge of laying a single brick:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/dark woods.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>So this diagram represents the challenge at hand anytime you take on a task, whether it's making a PowerPoint for work, going on a jog, working on a script, or anything else you do in your life. The Critical Entrance is where you go to officially start work on the task, the Dark Woods are the process of actually doing the work, and once you finish, you're rewarded by ending up in The Happy Playground - a place where you feel satisfaction and where leisure time is pleasant and rewarding because you got something hard done. You occasionally even end up super-engaged with what you're working on and enter a state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" target="_blank">Flow</a>, where you're so blissfully immersed in the task that you lose track of time.</p>
  <p>Those paths look something like this:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/dark woods pro good.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>Sounds pretty simple, right?</p>
  <p>Well unfortunately for procrastinators, they tend to miss out on both The Happy Playground and Flow.</p>
  <p>For example, here's a procrastinator that never even gets started on the task he's supposed to do, because he never makes it through the Critical Entrance. Instead, he spends hours wallowing in The Dark Playground, hating himself:</p>

  <p>Here's a procrastinator who gets started on the task, but she can't stay focused, and she keeps taking long breaks to play on the internet and make food. She doesn't end up finishing the task:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/dark woods pro 2.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>Here's a procrastinator who couldn't bring himself to get started, even though a work deadline was approaching, and he spent hours in The Dark Playground, knowing the looming deadline was drawing near and he was only making his life harder by not starting. Eventually, the deadline got so close, the Panic Monster suddenly came roaring into the room, freaking him out and causing him to fly through the task to hit the deadline.</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/dark woods pro 3.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>After he finishes, he feels decent because he accomplished something, but he's also not that pleased because he knows he did an underwhelming job on the project because he had to rush so much, and he feels like he wasted most of his day procrastinating for no reason. This lands him in Mixed Feelings Park.</p>
  <p>So if you're a procrastinator, let's look at what you need to do to get on the right path, one that will leave you much happier.</p>
  <p>The first thing you <i>must</i> do is make it through the Critical Entrance. This means stopping whatever you're doing when it's time to begin the task, putting away all distractions, and getting started. It sounds simple, but this is the hardest part. This is where the Instant Gratification Monkey puts up his fiercest resistance:</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/The Critical Entrance.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>The monkey absolutely <i>hates</i> stopping something fun to start something hard, and this is where you need to be the strongest. If you can get started and force the monkey into the Dark Woods, you've broken a bit of his will.</p>
  <p>Of course, he's not going to give up anytime soon.</p>
  <p>The Dark Woods is where you are when you're working. It's not a fun place to be, and the Instant Gratification Monkey wants nothing to do with it. To make things harder, the Dark Woods is <i>surrounded</i> by the Dark Playground, one of the monkey's favorite places, and since he can see how close it is, he'll try as hard as he can to leave the Dark Woods.</p>
  <p>There will also be times when you bump into a tree! <br>
    <img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/images/treelarger.jpg"> <br>
    Maybe the jog is taking you on an uphill street, maybe you need to use an Excel formula you don't know, maybe that song you're writing just isn't coming together the way you thought it would - and this is when the monkey will make his boldest attempt at an escape.</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/Pathways.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>It makes no sense to leave the Dark Woods in favor of the Dark Playground - they're both dark. They both suck to be in, but the big difference is the Dark Woods leads to happiness and the Dark Playground leads only to more misery. But the Instant Gratification Monkey isn't logical and to him, the Dark Playground seems like much more fun.</p>
  <p>The good news is, if you can power through a bit of the Dark Woods, something funny (amazing) happens. Making progress on a task produces positive feelings of accomplishment and raises your self-esteem. The monkey gains his strength off of low self-esteem, and when you feel a jolt of self-satisfaction, the monkey finds a High Self-Esteem Banana in his path. It doesn't quell his resistance entirely, but it goes a long way to distracting him for a while, and you'll find that the urge to procrastinate has diminished.</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/Pathways banana.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>Then, if you continue along, something magical happens. Once you get 2/3 or 3/4 of the way through a task, especially if it's going well, you start to feel great about things and suddenly, the end is in sight. This is a key tipping point - </p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/dark woods tipping point.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>The Tipping Point is important because it's not just you who can smell the Happy Playground up ahead - <i>the monkey can smell it too</i>. The monkey doesn't care if his instant gratification comes alongside you or at your expense, he just loves things that are easy and fun. Once you hit the Tipping Point, the monkey becomes <i>more interested in getting to the Happy Playground than the Dark Playground.</i> When this happens, you lose all impulse to procrastinate and now both you and the monkey are speeding toward the finish.</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/running.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>Before you know it, you're done, and you're in the Happy Playground. Now, for the first time in a while, you and the monkey are a<i> team. </i>You both want to have fun, and it feels great because it's <i>earned</i>. When you and the monkey are on a team, you're almost always happy.</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/happy playground.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>The other thing that might happen when you pass the Tipping Point, depending on the type of task and how well it's going, is that you might start feeling <i>fantastic</i> about what you're working on, so fantastic that continuing to work sounds like <i>much</i> more fun than stopping to do leisure activities. You've become obsessed with the task and you lose interest in basically everything else, including food and time - this is called Flow. Flow is not only a blissful feeling, it's usually when you do great things.</p>
  <p>The monkey is just as addicted to the bliss as you are, and you two are again a team.</p>
  <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/flow.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
  <p>Fighting through to the Tipping Point is hard, but what makes procrastination <i>so</i> hard to beat is that the Instant Gratification Monkey has a terribly short-term memory - even if you wildly succeed on Monday, when you begin a task on Tuesday, the monkey has forgotten everything and will again resist entering the Dark Woods or working through them.</p>
  <p>And that's why persistence is such a critical component of success. Laying each brick yields an inner struggle - and in the end, your ability to win this very specific struggle and lay brick after brick, day after day, is what lies at the core of a procrastinator's struggle to gain control over his world.</p>
  <p>So that's what needs to happen - but if procrastination could be solved by reading this, it wouldn't be such a large problem in so many people's lives. There's only one way to truly beat procrastination:</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><b>You need to prove to yourself that you can do it.</b></span></p>
  <p>You need to show yourself you can do it, not tell yourself. Things will change when you show yourself that they can. Until then, you won't believe it, and nothing will change. Think of yourself like a basketball player on a cold streak. For basketball players, it's all about confidence, and an ice cold shooter can tell himself 1000 times, &quot;I'm a great shooter, I'm going to hit this next one,&quot; but it's not until he physically hits a shot that his confidence goes up and his touch comes back.</p>
  <p>So how do you start hitting shots?</p>
  <p><b>1) Try to internalize the fact that everything you do is a choice. </b></p>
  <p>Start by thinking about the terms we've used here, and if they resonated with you, write them down. I have put them at the top of the page for you! Part of the reason I assigned terms to so many of these feelings or phenomena - the Instant Gratification Monkey, the Rational Decision Maker, the Panic Monster, the Dark Playground, Ickiness, Bricks, the Critical Entrance, the Dark Woods, the Tipping Point, the Happy Playground, Flow, your Storyline - is that terms help you clarify the reality of the choices you're making. It helps expose bad choices and highlights when it's most critical to make good ones.</p>
  <p><b>2) Create methods to help you defeat the monkey. </b></p>
  <p>Some possible methods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Solicit external support by telling one or more friends or family members about a goal you're trying to accomplish and asking them to hold you to it. If that's hard for whatever reason, email it to me - I'm a stranger (mark@pmway.co.za) - and just typing out a goal and sending it to a real person can help make it more real. (Some experts argue that telling people in your life about a goal can be counterproductive, so this depends on your particular situation.)</li>
    <li>Create a Panic Monster if there's not already one in place - if you're trying to finish an album, schedule a performance for a few months from now, book a space, and send out an invitation to a group of people.</li>
    <li>If you really want to start a business, quitting your job makes the Panic Monster your new roommate.</li>
    <li>If you're trying to write a consistent blog, put &quot;new post every Tuesday&quot; at the top of the page&#8230;</li>
    <li>Leave post-it notes for yourself, reminding you to make good choices.</li>
    <li>Set an alarm to remind yourself to start a task, or to remind you of the stakes.</li>
    <li>Minimize distractions by all means necessary. If TV's a huge problem, sell your TV. If the internet's a huge problem, get a second computer for work that has Wifi disabled, and turn your phone on Airplane Mode during work sessions.</li>
    <li>Lock yourself into something - put down a non-refundable deposit for lessons or a membership.</li>
    <li>Take a look at Trello. The Trello board is free and will allow you to create TO DO and DO and DONE columns to manage your tasks. <br>
      <a href="/homeviewvideo/resources/kanban.mp4" target="_blank ">The video here</a> explains how to go about this in a way that will work.<br>
      <img alt=" " class="img-fluid " src="/images/trello.jpg " ></li>
  </ul>
  <p>And if the methods you set up aren't working, change them. Set a reminder for a month from now that says,
    &quot;Have things improved? If not, change my methods.&quot;</p>
  <p><b>3) Aim for slow, steady progress - Storylines are rewritten one page at a time.</b></p>
  <p>The best way is step by step keeping yourself "in gradient" <br>
    <img alt=" " class="img-fluid " src="/images/stepbystep.png " ><br>
    <br>
    <b>If you are feeling like this...</b><img alt=" " class="img-fluid " src="/images/toosteep.png " ><br>
    <br>
    <b>then possibly milestones are too much</b><br>

                      words. The moment the student goes past misunderstood words and symbols he will experience
                      a 'mental blank' and find the instructions incomprehensible. When

                      in this manual are: using pictures and videos to show parts and tools of the subject
                      taught. Also having the student doing <i> demonstrations</i> by representing tools and
                      parts with small objects. Important parts and principles should be <i> demonstrated
                      in clay</i>. The student simply makes a representation in clay of the things described and
                      labels each part.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa">Another simple remedy is to have the student do Reach
                      and Withdraw on physical objects involved.</font> <font face="Ottawa">Let's say
                      he is learning about car motors. Under supervision he is simply made to touch
                      parts of a motor pointed out by another student. Each time he touches that part
                      he is acknowledged and a new part is chosen. The student running this drill
                      would simply point out a part and not demand the student explain anything
                      about it but simply have him touch it. By keeping this up for a while the
                      student will feel his 'lack of mass' is being repaired and will feel more
                      relaxed and happy about the whole subject. As a result much or all of the
                      described symptoms will disappear.</font></p>

                      Too steep a gradient applies especially to practical skills and actions - what
                      we call doingness. But it also applies to understanding itself.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa"><b>Reactions:</b> If you push a student along on too
                      steep a gradient he will experience one or more of the following mental and physiological
                      reactions: confusion, disorientation and being spun around. The parts he is
                      trying to learn seem to be less solid and in random motion.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa">Too steep a gradient means it was too much of a jump. He
                      didn't understand what he was doing or was supposed to do and he was started on
                      the next step or skill level. Routinely he will feel the new level is where his
                      difficulties are. He will assign it all to this new level. But the truth is
                      that is was on the previous level. The remedy is to put him one step back and
                      really make him able to perform that skill well. The actual missed gradient was
                      at the tail end of the previous level. As stated, this applies especially to
                      doingness, to practical actions.<br>
                      If we again use repairing of motors as an example, the student may have learned
                      how to use wrenches and then start to learn how to take a motor apart. Let's say
                      he finds this awfully confusing. Chances are he does not know enough about using
                      the wrenches he is supposed to use.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa"><b>Remedy: </b> The remedy is to
                      put him back on the step he didn't master. Have him practice using the wrenches
                      on different knots and bolts without adding the complexities of a whole motor to
                      it. Is he holding the wrench right? Does he know what to do to overcome a resistant
                      knot or bolt? Does he know how to loosen up a rusty bolt with chemicals, and so
                      on?</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa">Sometimes an instructor has to be inventive in realizing
                      what simpler skills go into a more complicated skill. Maybe the materials
                      themselves did not predict the type of difficulties and missing skills the
                      student could get hung up on. A good instructor will be able to remedy this and
                      break a complicated action down into the component parts. He then has the
                      student practice each little skill before he is made to put it all together.
                      Instructors mastering this little point are often looked upon with awe as they
                      can teach the &quot;most clumsy and stupid students&quot; to become competent.
                      It does take an ability to observe and analyze, but it really does not take
                      genius to overcome these things as an instructor.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa">This phenomenon of the skipped gradient is somewhat
                      similar to the last phenomenon, the misunderstood word, but it stands alone as
                      it is not rooted in misunderstood words, but in too much motion or randomity for
                      the student to handle. It's the complexity of the action that throws him off.</font></p>

                      completely falling asleep), or utter non-comprehension, and violent disagreement

                      physically, but they don't produce blows. It takes bypassed definitions to
                      bring that about.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa">The bypassed definition is the most important barrier. It
                      affects human relationships, the mind, and subjects. It is a prime element of
                      aptitude or lack of aptitude and it's what psychologists have been trying to
                      test for years without knowing exactly what it was.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Ottawa">It's the definitions of words. Misunderstood words and

The procrastinator who gets slightly better every week is a totally changed person a year later.</p>
  <p>So don't think about going from A to Z - just start with A to B. Change the Storyline from &quot;I procrastinate on every hard task I do&quot; to &quot;Once a week, I do a hard task without procrastinating.&quot; If you can do that, you've started an upward (pro survival) <a href="/home/gamestats" target="_blank "><i>trend</i></a>. I'm still a wretched procrastinator, but I'm definitely better than I was last year, so I feel hopeful about the future.<br>
    <br>
    Remember defeating procrastination is the same thing as gaining control over your own life. So much of what makes people happy or unhappy
    - their level of fulfillment and satisfaction, their self-esteem, the regrets they carry with them, the amount of free time they have to dedicate to their relationships
    - is severely affected by procrastination. So it's worthy of being taken dead seriously, and the time to start improving is now.</p>
