  <h3>Freedoms, Barriers and Goals</h3>
  <p>After you have read this page, ask yourself if you can you see how this relates to <a href="/pmway/?slide=1" target="_blank">Professional Project Management</a> and <a href="/pmway/?slide=2" target="_blank">Governance</a></p>

  <p>Our choices in life and how we live our life are
    governed by 3 things:&nbsp; <br>
    <b>FREEDOMS, BARRIERS and
    GOALS.</b></p>
  <p> A bottle is a perfect example of freedoms, barriers and goals in harmony.<br>
    Utilizing freedoms, barriers and goals the bottle (filled with beer let us say) can be bought as one of six in a six pack, stored in a fridge or pantry, and eventually used to pour the beer in a glass, or to drink the beer directly from the bottle.<br>
  <p> <img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/images/bottle.png" > &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/images/sixpackofbeer.png" ></p>
  <p> The same idea applies to a dam.&nbsp; I.e. barriers to contain the
    freedom of water so that it can be channeled towards the goal of water
    provision.</p>
  <p> <img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/images/dam.jpg" ></p>
  <p>And if you think carefully about it, so to is the PMBOK Dashboard (or other project method)
    also reliant on the concept of freedoms, barriers and goals.<br>
    To this end project constraints (the knowledge areas on the left of the dashboard) need to be planned for and utilized (monitored and controlled) so that the project goal is achieved.</p>
  <p> <img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/images/mainprocessdashraised.png" ></p>
  <p> Living life successfully, being able to improve it by utilizing products and also the running
    of successful projects, is all about understanding these three
    conditions and being able to recognize them and work within them, keeping them
    in balance</p>
  <h5> Let's dig a little deeper:</h5>
  <p>NB Stick with me as I develop this argument. Remember that <a href="/home/about" target="_blank">PMWay is primarily an ideas web</a>!  Therefore, as we explore these ideas, know that it can get a bit messy as we play around in the sandbox.</p>
  <p> When
    you were a baby you had no barriers.&nbsp; In Psychology we would say that you
    had no ego boundaries.<br>
    When you were hungry, you cried and you were fed.<br>
    When you were cold, you cried and were wrapped up in a warm blanket.<br>
    When you
    were wet, you cried and were changed and cuddled and everything was made warm
    and right again.<br>
    <br>
    As you grew up life started to bump into you and started to push your ego
    boundaries back into place.<br>
    Your ego boundaries snapped back from a (fantasy)
    position where you thought there were no barriers at all, to being in a more realistic place which is aligned with the real
    world.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Living in the real world should not be about the fantasy of total freedom, but rather
    a realization of real freedoms earned
    within barriers. <br>
    I.e. The transition of total freedom to freedom within
    barriers was learned (started to happen to you) when, for example, you started to walk as a baby and then
    bumped into a table and felt pain.&nbsp; Oops... something painful stopping me and
    is in my way!&nbsp; Possibly if I go around the table by moving like this....<br>
    Or you had a temper tantrum and demanded something that
    your parents suddenly did not give you.<br>
    Or someone at junior school
    started screaming because you took their toy away from them and the teacher
    reprimanded you.<br>
    etc.</p>
  <p> An example of behavior without barriers could
    be an older child that is never
    disciplined and can do whatever it wants&nbsp; I.e. the child is growing up and
    is not being taught the importance of barriers or boundaries.<br>
    <br>
    Or a teenager who has not moved out of the unrealistic mindset of total freedom
    and who is extremely lazy and
    who wants to live a constant life of freedoms&nbsp; I.e. without barriers or
    goals (the self discipline needed to achieve goals).<br>
    <br>
    A
    drug addict is another more extreme example of this type of person who wants
    total freedom all the time and (because they cannot put into place the necessary
    barriers / have not put goals into place within the barriers needed to achieve them) actually wants to escape totally from the rigors of life
    into a world that is constructed by a pain relieving drug induced haze.<br>
    <br>
    The word &quot;NO&quot;
    can be a positive word
    that puts boundaries back into place and teaches us how to live within constraints
    while interacting constructively with each other
    and in groups.<br>
    <br>
    The word &quot;Respect&quot; is a word that shows that you have an
    understanding of and respect for the boundaries of others.&nbsp; I.e. Their
    privacy, their possessions etc.</p>
  <p> If this were a utopian world, and we could all get
    everything we wanted, whenever we wanted,  then unrealistic expectations (now
    made realistic because of utopia) would never be a problem.&nbsp;
    But the fact is that we
    all live in a physical world where there are laws of nature (the economic laws
    of scarcity) and as such there is also fierce competition for resources.&nbsp;
    In looking for work (jobs) there is also competition for successful lucrative positions etc.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Economists refer to this as having a &quot;multiplicity
    of wants&quot; and trying to satisfy these wants with &quot;scarce resources&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    (Resources are broadly categorized into <strong>Land</strong> (physical resources /oil,
    minerals, steel, land that can be used to grow crops etc.), <strong>Labor</strong> (which is the
    work force) and <strong>Capital</strong> (which is buying power I.e. credit, money, savings etc.).&nbsp;
    But there is also the fourth and most important resource which is the <strong>Entrepreneur</strong>.&nbsp; The Entrepreneur is the person with the training, intellect,
    courage to take risks, and savvy to pull all the other resources together to
    make a successful market offering and ultimately a success in business.&nbsp;
    Entrepreneurs are a very scarce resource and it is not easy to be a successful
    Entrepreneur.&nbsp; It is the Entrepreneur who sees the goal [the need] and is able to
    navigate around the barriers and hit it in the target area. [satisfy the need])<br>
    <br>
    The
    above said, the old story of the golden goose which lays a single
    golden egg each day also remains relevant and true.&nbsp;
    Being greedy, the recipient of the regular golden egg
    may decide that it would be better
    if the head of the goose is chopped off to
    find all of the eggs (more eggs) at once!&nbsp; But with this comes the demise of the goose
    and the end of&nbsp; the golden eggs!&nbsp; This is also an example of the misuse and misunderstanding
    of how to keep Freedoms, Barriers and Goals in balance.</p>
  <p> The existence of too many barriers can also
    be a problem as this can force a person into overwhelm where they do not think
    that they can succeed and can, as a result, give up and stop pushing for success&nbsp;
    all-together (called a
    &quot;blow&quot; condition where they suddenly up and leave, refusing to play the
    game any longer).&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Or someone who works all
    the time (overcoming one barrier after the next) and as such has no time left for their spouse or family.&nbsp;
    I.e. they are too rigid
    and have surrounded themselves with too many goals, enforcing the barriers
    necessary to obtain them (staying at work until late each night etc.) and
    has few freedoms.&nbsp; What
    normally happens with this type of person is that suddenly, one day, they meet
    someone at work and have a wonderful affair (their ego boundaries collapse and
    they become like children again with no cares or responsibilities) but then they wake
    up later, as their ego boundaries snap back into place and realize the
    disastrous consequences of their actions, after their family has
    disintegrated into
    the devastation of divorce.
  <p> A person who has too many goals but does not
    chase each one down effectively  (in a stepwise and realistic / rational manner) is another example of one of the conditions
    being out of kilter with the rest.	This could be the typical Jack of all trades
    who is a master of none.</p>
  <p> And finally barriers can also be used to play games as this image
    shows.<br>
    I.e. withholding information,
    undermining, blocking initiative etc.<br>
    Risk management in Project Management (the Risk Management Knowledge Area in the PMBOK dashboard above) is all about being able to rapidly break down the barrier that could potentially or is stopping a project from getting safely and quickly to its destination.</p>
  <p> <img alt=""class="img-fluid" src="/images/barrier.GIF" ></p>
  <p> One could argue that achieving goals
    through hard work is good.&nbsp;And it is!&nbsp; <br>
    But the trick is that a balance must be maintained between
    enough work to achieve the goal and a goal that will cost too much to achieve.&nbsp;
    I.e. you eventually achieve your goal, but at the expense of your relationship
    with your family (I.e. your wife and children), or the cost of your health etc.&nbsp;
    Or a project (and expectations) is being run without sufficient resources or
    unrealistic timelines, unrealistic pressure to force delivery to achieve
    unrealistic outputs
    etc.<br>
    In this regard my guru W. Edwards Deming is quoted thus: <br>
    "It does not happen all at once.  There is (more often than not) no instant pudding&quot; and &quot;a goal without
    a method is nonsense!&quot;</p>
  <h5>Conclusion</h5>
  <p> Balance in life is about understanding the 3 conditions and the impact they can have on you; then
    working within them in a rational manner towards the achievement of your (or
    your team's) goals
    (within and navigating barriers) for success. </p>
