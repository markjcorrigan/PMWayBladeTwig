          CMMi is based in

          cycle, his Red Bead Experiment and his 14 Observations for

          CMMi Dev 3.1 is one
          of 4 Dashboards from the CMMi suite which includes process
          improvement for Development,

        <h3>Using Agile and SCRUM <br>
          to show<br>
          why process focus
          is crucial for success<br>
          (I.e. PP and PMC as core processes are
          equally relevant and important for Agile)</h3>
        <p>If you have the
          maturity and capability to run agile at Capability Maturity Level 2 and above</p>
        <p align="left">Before you throw away the idea of the PMBOK as
          no longer relevant,
          can you see that <strong>PP and PMC are also essential in Agile</strong>,
          clearly illustrated in these images from the
          SCRUM method below.&nbsp; I.e. the Product Owner as &quot;Big Dog&quot; must define
          requirements (PP), hand these over to the Scrum Master (and
          scrum team) and then &quot;Big Dog&quot; checks that quality delivery
          (working software) did in fact happen during the sprint in the
          &quot;Demonstrate and Validate Sprint&quot; process (PMC).&nbsp; I.e.
          Scrum sprints are engines to produce outputs defined by the
          Product Owner in the Product and Sprint backlogs (ranked for
          quickest / highest value gain) in the form of working software!</p>

        <p align="left"><strong>Step 3.</strong>&nbsp; Now find the Requirements Management <strong>(REQM) Process Area</strong> within the <strong>Engineering Category</strong>. This is a Level 2 process. These, via ITIL
          (The IT Infrastructure Library, as best practice dealt with in
          more detail within PMWay) <strong>Service Catalogues</strong> (for example), will form the process improvements (the glue) that
          is needed (by each IT system) for competitive success.<br>
          Per
          Deming, the People, Process and Technology triad is essential,
          with process the glue that holds the triad together.&nbsp; Put
          another way, to expand the triad (to improve towards higher
          productivity and quality), triangle points must be pulled out
          in a balanced manner, via process improvements focus.&nbsp;
          I.e. you need to focus on all the points at the same time for success, but
          starting with process improvements in how people work.&nbsp; Deming insisted that 85 to 97 percent of problems in an organization are the
          responsibility of management.&nbsp; Once these hit the factory floor there
          is very little that your people (EVEN YOUR BEST PEOPLE WITH THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD) can do
          from the floor to improve their (or the business) situation.&nbsp; I.e. the
          most valuable process improvements must be engineered back into your systems
          (via software projects) so that your people can be empowered to use their
          (the business) technology to better service your valued clients.&nbsp; This
          must be an empowering and realistic imperative from the very top of the
          organization!</p>

        <p class align="left"><strong>Bonus Step.</strong>&nbsp; As a
          bonus step find <strong>RSKM</strong>.&nbsp; This is Risk
          Management and is a <strong>CM</strong> Level 3 <strong>Project Management
          Category</strong> process.&nbsp;
          PMWay suggests that RSKM is crucial if agile (or traditional)
          project management is going to be attempted at CM Level 1.&nbsp; </p>
        <hr>
        <p class align="left"><strong>Bonus Step.</strong>&nbsp; The<strong> MA</strong> process from the <strong>Support Category</strong> will require
          a Project Management Information System (PMIS) to ensure that
          TAsking (Time Asking) of a resources time and the production
          from this time allocation is measured for productivity and quality.&nbsp; Put a
          PMIS into place and manage it carefully and <strong>MA</strong> is automatically
          handled.&nbsp; I.e. as an accounting system automatically
          handles a consolidation of accounting entries to form your book
          of account and financial reports.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class align="left"><strong>Conclusion:&nbsp; </strong>PMWay's advice
          (for both Traditional and Agile Project Management) is to zero in on <strong>PP</strong> and <strong>PMC</strong> as these CM Level 2 processes are crucial for success.  Then make sure that <strong>RSKM</strong> is working, even if <strong>RSKM</strong> is a CM Level 3 process.
          On a PMIS RSKM can be handled within the collaborative
          environment with escalation to project sponsors for stuff that
          the team cannot deal with!&nbsp; Then make sure that <strong>PP</strong> and <strong>PMC</strong> address <strong>REQM</strong>, <strong>CM</strong> at CM L2 and <strong>VER</strong> and <strong>VAL</strong> at CM L3.&nbsp;  With this in place (and off this firm base) you can start to pull in the other
          CMMi processes listed above.&nbsp;
          With a well managed PMIS you will automatically dust <strong>MA</strong>.&nbsp;
          CMMi core L2 and core parts of L3 installed. <br>

          <p align="left"> PMWay loves agile!&nbsp;
            PRINCE2 Agile, DSDM, SCRUM, XP and other agile method detail is found
            within this web.&nbsp; However (when discussing agility without software
            engineering savvy), software design, development and deployment
            of technology are complex undertakings!  According to Frederick P. Brooks (an
            American computer architect, software engineer, and
            computer scientist) of &quot;No Silver Bullet - Essence
            and Accident in Software Engineering&quot; fame, these "can be regarded
            as being one of the most difficult undertakings".&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            In Brooks' Anniversary
            Edition, some 20 years after the original publication of the Essays on Software
            Engineering, he again emphasized project complexity and why software development
            projects, to create "programming systems products" can, if not carefully managed, often
            become mired in ever-increasing difficulties he called the tar pit of failed software projects.
            [<strong>The La Brea Tar Pits</strong> are one of the world's best repositories for fossilized vertebrates.
            Animals would wander on top of a<strong> tar pit</strong> (which was hidden through dust,
            leaves, or other such detritus), and become trapped. Predators, attracted by the struggles
            of a trapped animal become trapped themselves.&nbsp; Hence, fossilized vertebrates in the <strong>tar pit</strong> is a metaphor for failed software projects blundering blindly into serious danger
            from which they cannot escape.]</p>
          <p align="left">While SCRUM, DSDM and other pure agile
            methods are awesome; they really do require Empowered
            Teams of highly skilled IT staff operating at People Capability
            Maturity Level 4 (Predictable) for success, if software
            is mission critical and complexity is an issue!</p>
